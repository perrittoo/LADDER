Finally O

There O
actually O
is O
malware O
in O
the O
wild O
that O
targets O

— O
it O
’ O

been O
proved O
a O
number O
of O
times O
, O
and O
in O
August O
2016 O
researchers O
proved O
it O
again O
by O
revealing O
the O
existence O
of O
Pegasus O
, O
spyware O
capable O
of O
hacking O
any O

about ATK

It O
’ O

also O
noteworthy O
that O

even O
listen ATK

read ATK

) ATK
. O

Another O
interesting O
fact O
about O
Pegasus O
is O
that O
it O
tries O
to O
hide ATK
itself ATK
really ATK
diligently ATK
. O

The O
malware O
self-destructs O
if ATK

not ATK

Another O
difference O
: O
If O

the O
