It O
started O

In O
most O
cases O

One O
of O
the O
recent O

The O

An O
additional O
technique O
the O
malware O
uses O
is O
generating ATK
fake ATK
push ATK

Fake ATK

A O
few O
months O
ago O
, O
Ginp O
developers O
introduced O
a O
new O
feature O
that O
allows ATK
the ATK
malware ATK
to ATK
block ATK
all ATK
push ATK
notifications ATK
from ATK
legitimate ATK
applications ATK
. O

This O
is O
particularly O
helpful O
to O
attackers O
, O
as O
it O
can O
block ATK

about ATK
the ATK
fraudulent ATK

taking ATK
place ATK
, O
thus O
avoiding O
arousing O
suspicion O

the O
victim O

Additionally O
, O
the O

This O
feature O
allows O
attackers O

that ATK
can ATK
enable ATK
them ATK
to ATK
circumvent ATK

The O

conduct ATK

the O
risk O

These O
overlay ATK
pages ATK
are ATK
similar ATK

regular ATK
ones ATK
, ATK
but ATK
persist ATK
on ATK
the ATK

and ATK
keep ATK

This O
feature O
blocks ATK

released ATK

This O
feature O
creates ATK
advantages ATK
