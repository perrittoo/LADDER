T1066,Indicator Removal from Tools,"If a malicious tool is detected and quarantined or otherwise curtailed, an adversary may be able to determine why the malicious tool was detected (the indicator), modify the tool by removing the indicator, and use the updated version that is no longer detected by the target's defensive systems or subsequent targets that may use similar systems.  A good example of this is when malware is detected with a file signature and quarantined by anti-virus software. An adversary who can determine that the malware was quarantined because of its file signature may use [Software Packing] or otherwise modify the file so it has a different signature, and then re-use the malware.",[]
T1557,Adversary-in-the-Middle,"Adversaries may attempt to position themselves between two or more networked devices using an adversary-in-the-middle (AiTM) technique to support follow-on behaviors such as [Network Sniffing] [Transmitted Data Manipulation] or replay attacks ([Exploitation for Credential Access] By abusing features of common networking protocols that can determine the flow of network traffic (e.g. ARP, DNS, LLMNR, etc.), adversaries may force a device to communicate through an adversary controlled system so they can collect information or perform additional actions.  For example, adversaries may manipulate victim DNS settings to enable other malicious activities such as preventing/redirecting users from accessing legitimate sites and/or pushing additional malware. Adversaries may also manipulate DNS and leverage their position in order to intercept user credentials and session cookies. [Downgrade Attack] can also be used to establish an AiTM position, such as by negotiating a less secure, deprecated, or weaker version of communication protocol (SSL/TLS) or encryption algorithm.  Adversaries may also leverage the AiTM position to attempt to monitor and/or modify traffic, such as in [Transmitted Data Manipulation] Adversaries can setup a position similar to AiTM to prevent traffic from flowing to the appropriate destination, potentially to [Impair Defenses] and/or in support of a [Network Denial of Service]","['[Dok] proxies web traffic to potentially monitor and alter victim HTTP(S) traffic.', '[Kimsuky] has used modified versions of PHProxy to examine web traffic between the victim and the accessed website.']"
T1003,OS Credential Dumping,"Adversaries may attempt to dump credentials to obtain account login and credential material, normally in the form of a hash or a clear text password, from the operating system and software. Credentials can then be used to perform [Lateral Movement] and access restricted information.  Several of the tools mentioned in associated sub-techniques may be used by both adversaries and professional security testers. Additional custom tools likely exist as well. ","['[APT39] has used different versions of Mimikatz to obtain credentials.', '[Carbanak] obtains Windows logon password details.', '[Revenge RAT] has a plugin for credential harvesting.', '[PinchDuke] steals credentials from compromised hosts. [PinchDuke] credential stealing functionality is believed to be based on the source code of the Pinch credential stealing malware (also known as LdPinch). Credentials targeted by [PinchDuke] include ones associated many sources such as WinInet Credential Cache, and Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP).', '[Poseidon Group] conducts credential dumping on victims, with a focus on obtaining credentials belonging to domain and database servers.', '[OnionDuke] steals credentials from its victims.', '[Tonto Team] has used a variety of credential dumping tools.

T1133,External Remote Services,"Adversaries may leverage external-facing remote services to initially access and/or persist within a network. Remote services such as VPNs, Citrix, and other access mechanisms allow users to connect to internal enterprise network resources from external locations. There are often remote service gateways that manage connections and credential authentication for these services. Services such as [Windows Remote Management] and [VNC] can also be used externally.  Access to [Valid Accounts] to use the service is often a requirement, which could be obtained through credential pharming or by obtaining the credentials from users after compromising the enterprise network. Access to remote services may be used as a redundant or persistent access mechanism during an operation.  Access may also be gained through an exposed service that doesn’t require authentication. In containerized environments, this may include an exposed Docker API, Kubernetes API server, kubelet, or web application such as the Kubernetes dashboard.","['[TeamTNT] has used open-source tools such as Weave Scope to target exposed Docker API ports and gain initial access to victim environments. [TeamTNT] has also targeted exposed kubelets for Kubernetes environments.', '[FIN13] has gained access to compromised environments via remote access services such as the corporate virtual private network (VPN).', 'During [Operation CuckooBees] the threat actors enabled WinRM over HTTP/HTTPS as a backup persistence mechanism using the following command: `cscript //nologo ""C:\\Windows\\System32\\winrm.vbs"" set winrm/config/service@{EnableCompatibilityHttpsListener=""true""}`.', '[Linux Rabbit] attempts to gain access to the server via SSH.', 'During [Night Dragon] threat actors used compromised VPN accounts to gain access to victim systems.', '[Mafalda] can establish an SSH connection from a compromised host to a server.', '[APT18] actors leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.', '[TEMP.Veles] has used a VPN to persist in the victim environment.', ""[Sandworm Team] has used Dropbear SSH with a hardcoded backdoor password to maintain persistence within the target network.

T1539,Steal Web Session Cookie,"An adversary may steal web application or service session cookies and use them to gain access to web applications or Internet services as an authenticated user without needing credentials. Web applications and services often use session cookies as an authentication token after a user has authenticated to a website.  Cookies are often valid for an extended period of time, even if the web application is not actively used. Cookies can be found on disk, in the process memory of the browser, and in network traffic to remote systems. Additionally, other applications on the targets machine might store sensitive authentication cookies in memory (e.g. apps which authenticate to cloud services). Session cookies can be used to bypasses some multi-factor authentication protocols.  There are several examples of malware targeting cookies from web browsers on the local system. There are also open source frameworks such as `Evilginx2` and `Muraena` that can gather session cookies through a malicious proxy (ex: [Adversary-in-the-Middle] that can be set up by an adversary and used in phishing campaigns.  After an adversary acquires a valid cookie, they can then perform a [Web Session Cookie] technique to login to the corresponding web application.","['[LuminousMoth] has used an unnamed post-exploitation tool to steal cookies from the Chrome browser.', ""[Grandoreiro] can steal the victim's cookies to use for duplicating the active session from another device."", '[Evilnum] can steal cookies and session information from browsers.', '[CookieMiner] can steal Google Chrome and Apple Safari browser cookies from the victim’s machine. ', '[QakBot] has the ability to capture web session cookies.', '[EVILNUM] can harvest cookies and upload them to the C2 server.', '[Chaes] has used a script that extracts the web session cookie and sends it to the C2 server. ', '[BLUELIGHT] can harvest cookies from Internet Explorer, Edge, Chrome, and Naver Whale browsers.', 'During the [SolarWinds Compromise] [APT29] stole Chrome browser cookies by copying the Chrome profile directories of targeted users.', '[XCSSET] uses <code>scp</code> to access the <code>~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies</code> file.', '[TajMahal] has the ability to steal web session cookies from Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, FireFox and RealNetworks applications.', '[APT29] has stolen Chrome browser cookies by copying the Chrome profile directories of targeted users.']"
T1600,Weaken Encryption,"Adversaries may compromise a network device’s encryption capability in order to bypass encryption that would otherwise protect data communications.   Encryption can be used to protect transmitted network traffic to maintain its confidentiality (protect against unauthorized disclosure) and integrity (protect against unauthorized changes). Encryption ciphers are used to convert a plaintext message to ciphertext and can be computationally intensive to decipher without the associated decryption key. Typically, longer keys increase the cost of cryptanalysis, or decryption without the key.  Adversaries can compromise and manipulate devices that perform encryption of network traffic. For example, through behaviors such as [Modify System Image] [Reduce Key Space] and [Disable Crypto Hardware] an adversary can negatively effect and/or eliminate a device’s ability to securely encrypt network traffic. This poses a greater risk of unauthorized disclosure and may help facilitate data manipulation, Credential Access, or Collection efforts. ",[]
T1489,Service Stop,"Adversaries may stop or disable services on a system to render those services unavailable to legitimate users. Stopping critical services or processes can inhibit or stop response to an incident or aid in the adversary's overall objectives to cause damage to the environment.   Adversaries may accomplish this by disabling individual services of high importance to an organization, such as <code>MSExchangeIS</code>, which will make Exchange content inaccessible . In some cases, adversaries may stop or disable many or all services to render systems unusable. Services or processes may not allow for modification of their data stores while running. Adversaries may stop services or processes in order to conduct [Data Destruction] or [Data Encrypted for Impact] on the data stores of services like Exchange and SQL Server.","['[Clop] can kill several processes and services related to backups and security solutions. ', '[LookBack] can kill processes and delete services.', '[Meteor] can disconnect all network adapters on a compromised host using `powershell -Command ""Get-WmiObject -class Win32_NetworkAdapter | ForEach { If ($.NetEnabled) { $.Disable() } }"" > NUL`.', '[WannaCry] attempts to kill processes associated with Exchange, Microsoft SQL Server, and MySQL to make it possible to encrypt their data stores.', '[Royal] can use `RmShutDown` to kill  applications and services using the resources that are targeted for encryption.', '[Diavol] will terminate services using the Service Control Manager (SCM) API.

', '[Industroyer] data wiper module writes zeros into the registry keys in <code>SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Services</code> to render a system inoperable.', '[KillDisk] terminates various processes to get the user to reboot the victim machine.', '[Ragnar Locker] has attempted to stop services associated with business applications and databases to release the lock on files used by these applications so they may be encrypted.', '[SLOTHFULMEDIA] has the capability to stop processes and services.', '[HotCroissant] has the ability to stop services on the infected host.', '[EKANS] stops database, data backup solution, antivirus, and ICS-related processes.', '[AvosLocker] has terminated specific processes before encryption.', '[Wizard Spider] has used taskkill.exe and net.exe to stop backup, catalog, cloud, and other services prior to network encryption.', '[Pysa] can stop services and processes. ', '[HermeticWiper] has the ability to stop the Volume Shadow Copy service.', '[Maze] has stopped SQL services to ensure it can encrypt any database. ', '[Indrik Spider] has used [PsExec] to stop services prior to the execution of ransomware.', '[Netwalker] can terminate system processes and services, some of which relate to backup software.']"
T1080,Taint Shared Content," Adversaries may deliver payloads to remote systems by adding content to shared storage locations, such as network drives or internal code repositories. Content stored on network drives or in other shared locations may be tainted by adding malicious programs, scripts, or exploit code to otherwise valid files. Once a user opens the shared tainted content, the malicious portion can be executed to run the adversary's code on a remote system. Adversaries may use tainted shared content to move laterally.  A directory share pivot is a variation on this technique that uses several other techniques to propagate malware when users access a shared network directory. It uses [Shortcut Modification] of directory .LNK files that use [Masquerading] to look like the real directories, which are hidden through [Hidden Files and Directories] The malicious .LNK-based directories have an embedded command that executes the hidden malware file in the directory and then opens the real intended directory so that the user's expected action still occurs. When used with frequently used network directories, the technique may result in frequent reinfections and broad access to systems and potentially to new and higher privileged accounts.   Adversaries may also compromise shared network directories through binary infections by appending or prepending its code to the healthy binary on the shared network directory. The malware may modify the original entry point (OEP) of the healthy binary to ensure that it is executed before the legitimate code. The infection could continue to spread via the newly infected file when it is executed by a remote system. These infections may target both binary and non-binary formats that end with extensions including, but not limited to, .EXE, .DLL, .SCR, .BAT, and/or .VBS.","['[H1N1] has functionality to copy itself to network shares.', '[Darkhotel] used a virus that propagates by infecting executables stored on shared drives.', '[Ramsay] can spread itself by infecting other portable executable files on networks shared drives.\t', '[Gamaredon Group] has injected malicious macros into all Word and Excel documents on mapped network drives.', '[BRONZE BUTLER] has placed malware on file shares and given it the same name as legitimate documents on the share.', '[InvisiMole] can replace legitimate software or documents in the compromised network with their trojanized versions, in an attempt to propagate itself within the network.', '[Conti] can spread itself by infecting other remote machines via network shared drives. ', '[Miner-C] copies itself into the public folder of Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices and infects new victims who open the file.', '[Stuxnet] infects remote servers via network shares and by infecting WinCC database views with malicious code.', '[Ursnif] has copied itself to and infected files in network drives for propagation.']"
T1040,Network Sniffing,"Adversaries may sniff network traffic to capture information about an environment, including authentication material passed over the network. Network sniffing refers to using the network interface on a system to monitor or capture information sent over a wired or wireless connection. An adversary may place a network interface into promiscuous mode to passively access data in transit over the network, or use span ports to capture a larger amount of data.  Data captured via this technique may include user credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol. Techniques for name service resolution poisoning, such as [LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and SMB Relay] can also be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.  Network sniffing may also reveal configuration details, such as running services, version numbers, and other network characteristics (e.g. IP addresses, hostnames, VLAN IDs) necessary for subsequent Lateral Movement and/or Defense Evasion activities.  In cloud-based environments, adversaries may still be able to use traffic mirroring services to sniff network traffic from virtual machines. For example, AWS Traffic Mirroring, GCP Packet Mirroring, and Azure vTap allow users to define specified instances to collect traffic from and specified targets to send collected traffic to. Often, much of this traffic will be in cleartext due to the use of TLS termination at the load balancer level to reduce the strain of encrypting and decrypting traffic. The adversary can then use exfiltration techniques such as Transfer Data to Cloud Account in order to access the sniffed traffic.  On network devices, adversaries may perform network captures using [Network Device CLI] commands such as `monitor capture`.","['[Sandworm Team] has used intercepter-NG to sniff passwords in network traffic.\t', '[Kimsuky] has used the Nirsoft SniffPass network sniffer to obtain passwords sent over non-secure protocols.', '[Impacket] can be used to sniff network traffic via an interface or raw socket.', '[NBTscan] can dump and print whole packet content.\t', '[MESSAGETAP] uses the libpcap library to listen to all traffic and parses network protocols starting with Ethernet and IP layers.

']"
T1202,Indirect Command Execution,"Adversaries may abuse utilities that allow for command execution to bypass security restrictions that limit the use of command-line interpreters. Various Windows utilities may be used to execute commands, possibly without invoking [cmd] For example, [Forfiles] the Program Compatibility Assistant (pcalua.exe), components of the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), as well as other utilities may invoke the execution of programs and commands from a [Command and Scripting Interpreter] Run window, or via scripts.    Adversaries may abuse these features for [Defense Evasion] specifically to perform arbitrary execution while subverting detections and/or mitigation controls (such as Group Policy) that limit/prevent the usage of [cmd] or file extensions more commonly associated with malicious payloads.","['[Lazarus Group] persistence mechanisms have used <code>forfiles.exe</code> to execute .htm files.', '[Forfiles] can be used to subvert controls and possibly conceal command execution by not directly invoking [cmd]', '[Revenge RAT] uses the [Forfiles] utility to execute commands on the system.']"
T1091,Replication Through Removable Media,"Adversaries may move onto systems, possibly those on disconnected or air-gapped networks, by copying malware to removable media and taking advantage of Autorun features when the media is inserted into a system and executes. In the case of Lateral Movement, this may occur through modification of executable files stored on removable media or by copying malware and renaming it to look like a legitimate file to trick users into executing it on a separate system. In the case of Initial Access, this may occur through manual manipulation of the media, modification of systems used to initially format the media, or modification to the media's firmware itself.  Mobile devices may also be used to infect PCs with malware if connected via USB. This infection may be achieved using devices (Android, iOS, etc.) and, in some instances, USB charging cables. For example, when a smartphone is connected to a system, it may appear to be mounted similar to a USB-connected disk drive. If malware that is compatible with the connected system is on the mobile device, the malware could infect the machine (especially if Autorun features are enabled).","['[Flame] contains modules to infect USB sticks and spread laterally to other Windows systems the stick is plugged into using Autorun functionality.', '[APT30] may have used the [SHIPSHAPE] malware to move onto air-gapped networks.

T1562,Impair Defenses,"Adversaries may maliciously modify components of a victim environment in order to hinder or disable defensive mechanisms. This not only involves impairing preventative defenses, such as firewalls and anti-virus, but also detection capabilities that defenders can use to audit activity and identify malicious behavior. This may also span both native defenses as well as supplemental capabilities installed by users and administrators.  Adversaries may also impair routine operations that contribute to defensive hygiene, such as blocking users from logging out of a computer or stopping it from being shut down. These restrictions can further enable malicious operations as well as the continued propagation of incidents.  Adversaries could also target event aggregation and analysis mechanisms, or otherwise disrupt these procedures by altering other system components.","['[Stuxnet] reduces the integrity level of objects to allow write actions.', '[Magic Hound] has disabled LSA protection on compromised hosts using `""reg"" add HKLM\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\LSA /v RunAsPPL /t REG_DWORD /d 0 /f`.']"
T1190,Exploit Public-Facing Application,"Adversaries may attempt to exploit a weakness in an Internet-facing host or system to initially access a network. The weakness in the system can be a software bug, a temporary glitch, or a misconfiguration.  Exploited applications are often websites/web servers, but can also include databases (like SQL), standard services (like SMB or SSH), network device administration and management protocols (like SNMP and Smart Install), and any other system with Internet accessible open sockets. Depending on the flaw being exploited this may also involve [Exploitation for Defense Evasion]   If an application is hosted on cloud-based infrastructure and/or is containerized, then exploiting it may lead to compromise of the underlying instance or container. This can allow an adversary a path to access the cloud or container APIs, exploit container host access via [Escape to Host] or take advantage of weak identity and access management policies.  Adversaries may also exploit edge network infrastructure and related appliances, specifically targeting devices that do not support robust host-based defenses.  For websites and databases, the OWASP top 10 and CWE top 25 highlight the most common web-based vulnerabilities.","['During [C0027] [Scattered Spider] exploited CVE-2021-35464 in the ForgeRock Open Access Management (OpenAM) application server to gain initial access.', '[Rocke] exploited Apache Struts, Oracle WebLogic (CVE-2017-10271), and Adobe ColdFusion (CVE-2017-3066) vulnerabilities to deliver malware.', '[Threat Group-3390] has exploited the Microsoft SharePoint vulnerability CVE-2019-0604 and CVE-2021-26855, CVE-2021-26857, CVE-2021-26858, and CVE-2021-27065 in Exchange Server.', 'During [C0018] the threat actors exploited VMWare Horizon Unified Access Gateways that were vulnerable to several Log4Shell vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, CVE-2021-45105, and CVE-2021-44832.', '[Siloscape] is executed after the attacker gains initial access to a Windows container using a known vulnerability.

T1036,Masquerading,"Adversaries may attempt to manipulate features of their artifacts to make them appear legitimate or benign to users and/or security tools. Masquerading occurs when the name or location of an object, legitimate or malicious, is manipulated or abused for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may include manipulating file metadata, tricking users into misidentifying the file type, and giving legitimate task or service names.  Renaming abusable system utilities to evade security monitoring is also a form of [Masquerading] Masquerading may also include the use of [Proxy] or VPNs to disguise IP addresses, which can allow adversaries to blend in with normal network traffic and bypass conditional access policies or anti-abuse protections.","['[menuPass] has used [esentutl] to change file extensions to their true type that were masquerading as .txt files.

T1055,Process Injection,"Adversaries may inject code into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. Process injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process. Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via process injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.   There are many different ways to inject code into a process, many of which abuse legitimate functionalities. These implementations exist for every major OS but are typically platform specific.   More sophisticated samples may perform multiple process injections to segment modules and further evade detection, utilizing named pipes or other inter-process communication (IPC) mechanisms as a communication channel.

T1525,Implant Internal Image,"Adversaries may implant cloud or container images with malicious code to establish persistence after gaining access to an environment. Amazon Web Services (AWS) Amazon Machine Images (AMIs), Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Images, and Azure Images as well as popular container runtimes such as Docker can be implanted or backdoored. Unlike [Upload Malware] this technique focuses on adversaries implanting an image in a registry within a victim’s environment. Depending on how the infrastructure is provisioned, this could provide persistent access if the infrastructure provisioning tool is instructed to always use the latest image.  A tool has been developed to facilitate planting backdoors in cloud container images. If an adversary has access to a compromised AWS instance, and permissions to list the available container images, they may implant a backdoor such as a [Web Shell]",[]
T1550,Use Alternate Authentication Material,"Adversaries may use alternate authentication material, such as password hashes, Kerberos tickets, and application access tokens, in order to move laterally within an environment and bypass normal system access controls.   Authentication processes generally require a valid identity (e.g., username) along with one or more authentication factors (e.g., password, pin, physical smart card, token generator, etc.). Alternate authentication material is legitimately generated by systems after a user or application successfully authenticates by providing a valid identity and the required authentication factor(s). Alternate authentication material may also be generated during the identity creation process.  Caching alternate authentication material allows the system to verify an identity has successfully authenticated without asking the user to reenter authentication factor(s). Because the alternate authentication must be maintained by the system—either in memory or on disk—it may be at risk of being stolen through [Credential Access] techniques. By stealing alternate authentication material, adversaries are able to bypass system access controls and authenticate to systems without knowing the plaintext password or any additional authentication factors. ","['During the [SolarWinds Compromise] [APT29] used forged SAML tokens that allowed the actors to impersonate users and bypass MFA, enabling [APT29] to access enterprise cloud applications and services.', ""[FoggyWeb] can allow abuse of a compromised AD FS server's SAML token."", '[APT29] used forged SAML tokens that allowed the actors to impersonate users and bypass MFA, enabling [APT29] to access enterprise cloud applications and services.', '[UNC2452] used forged SAML tokens that allowed the actors to impersonate users and bypass MFA, enabling [UNC2452] to access enterprise cloud applications and services.']"
T1589,Gather Victim Identity Information,"Adversaries may gather information about the victim's identity that can be used during targeting. Information about identities may include a variety of details, including personal data (ex: employee names, email addresses, etc.) as well as sensitive details such as credentials.  Adversaries may gather this information in various ways, such as direct elicitation via [Phishing for Information] Information about users could also be enumerated via other active means (i.e. [Active Scanning] such as probing and analyzing responses from authentication services that may reveal valid usernames in a system. Information about victims may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets (ex: [Social Media] or [Search Victim-Owned Websites]  Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance (ex: [Search Open Websites/Domains] or [Phishing for Information] establishing operational resources (ex: [Compromise Accounts] and/or initial access (ex: [Phishing] or [Valid Accounts]","['[LAPSUS$] has gathered detailed information of target employees to enhance their social engineering lures.', '[HEXANE] has identified specific potential victims at targeted organizations.', '[FIN13] has researched employees to target for social engineering attacks.', 'For [Operation Dream Job] [Lazarus Group] conducted extensive reconnaissance research on potential targets.', '[APT32] has conducted targeted surveillance against activists and bloggers.', 'During [Operation Wocao] threat actors targeted people based on their organizational roles and privileges.', '[Magic Hound] has acquired mobile phone numbers of potential targets, possibly for mobile malware or additional phishing operations.']"
T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,"Adversaries may take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors, and intercept information as part of various browser session hijacking techniques.  A specific example is when an adversary injects software into a browser that allows them to inherit cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of a user then use the browser as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet. Executing browser-based behaviors such as pivoting may require specific process permissions, such as <code>SeDebugPrivilege</code> and/or high-integrity/administrator rights.  Another example involves pivoting browser traffic from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up a proxy which will redirect web traffic. This does not alter the user's traffic in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is closed. The adversary assumes the security context of whichever browser process the proxy is injected into. Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly. With these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an intranet, such as [Sharepoint] or webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions. Browser pivoting may also bypass security provided by 2-factor authentication.","['[TrickBot] uses web injects and browser redirection to trick the user into providing their login credentials on a fake or modified web page.', '[Dridex] can perform browser attacks via web injects to steal information such as credentials, certificates, and cookies.', '[Carberp] has captured credentials when a user performs login through a SSL session.', ""[Melcoz] can monitor the victim's browser for online banking sessions and display an overlay window to manipulate the session in the background."", '[Agent Tesla] has the ability to use form-grabbing to extract data from web data forms.', '[Grandoreiro] can monitor browser activity for online banking actions and display full-screen overlay images to block user access to the intended site or present additional data fields.', '[QakBot] can use advanced web injects to steal web banking credentials.', ""[Cobalt Strike] can perform browser pivoting and inject into a user's browser to inherit cookies, authenticated HTTP sessions, and client SSL certificates."", '[IcedID] has used web injection attacks to redirect victims to spoofed sites designed to harvest banking and other credentials.

T1491,Defacement,"Adversaries may modify visual content available internally or externally to an enterprise network, thus affecting the integrity of the original content. Reasons for [Defacement] include delivering messaging, intimidation, or claiming (possibly false) credit for an intrusion. Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of [Defacement] in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages.  ",[]
T1563,Remote Service Session Hijacking,"Adversaries may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment. Users may use valid credentials to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and RDP. When a user logs into a service, a session will be established that will allow them to maintain a continuous interaction with that service.  Adversaries may commandeer these sessions to carry out actions on remote systems. [Remote Service Session Hijacking] differs from use of [Remote Services] because it hijacks an existing session rather than creating a new session using [Valid Accounts]",[]
T1548,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions. Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine. Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk. An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.,[]
T1087,Account Discovery,"Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of valid accounts, usernames, or email addresses on a system or within a compromised environment. This information can help adversaries determine which accounts exist, which can aid in follow-on behavior such as brute-forcing, spear-phishing attacks, or account takeovers (e.g., [Valid Accounts]  Adversaries may use several methods to enumerate accounts, including abuse of existing tools, built-in commands, and potential misconfigurations that leak account names and roles or permissions in the targeted environment.  For examples, cloud environments typically provide easily accessible interfaces to obtain user lists. On hosts, adversaries can use default [PowerShell] and other command line functionality to identify accounts. Information about email addresses and accounts may also be extracted by searching an infected system’s files.","['[ShimRatReporter] listed all non-privileged and privileged accounts available on the machine.', '[Woody RAT] can identify administrator accounts on an infected machine.', ""[XCSSET] attempts to discover accounts from various locations such as a user's Evernote, AppleID, Telegram, Skype, and WeChat data."", 'During the [SolarWinds Compromise] [APT29] obtained a list of users and their roles from an Exchange server using `Get-ManagementRoleAssignment`.', ""[FIN13] has enumerated all users and their roles from a victim's main treasury system."", '[APT29] obtained a list of users and their roles from an Exchange server using <code>Get-ManagementRoleAssignment</code>.', '[UNC2452] obtained a list of users and their roles from an Exchange server using <code>Get-ManagementRoleAssignment</code>.', '[APT32] enumerated administrative users and DC servers using the commands <code>net localgroup administrators</code> and <code>net group ""Domain Controllers"" /domain</code>.']"
T1059,Command and Scripting Interpreter,"Adversaries may abuse command and script interpreters to execute commands, scripts, or binaries. These interfaces and languages provide ways of interacting with computer systems and are a common feature across many different platforms. Most systems come with some built-in command-line interface and scripting capabilities, for example, macOS and Linux distributions include some flavor of [Unix Shell] while Windows installations include the [Windows Command Shell] and [PowerShell]  There are also cross-platform interpreters such as [Python] as well as those commonly associated with client applications such as [JavaScript] and [Visual Basic]  Adversaries may abuse these technologies in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands. Commands and scripts can be embedded in [Initial Access] payloads delivered to victims as lure documents or as secondary payloads downloaded from an existing C2. Adversaries may also execute commands through interactive terminals/shells, as well as utilize various [Remote Services] in order to achieve remote Execution.","['[Fox Kitten] has used a Perl reverse shell to communicate with C2.', '[Stealth Falcon] malware uses WMI to script data collection and command execution on the victim.', ""[FIN7] used SQL scripts to help perform tasks on the victim's machine."", '[DarkComet] can execute various types of scripts on the victim’s machine.', '[FIN6] has used scripting to iterate through a list of compromised PoS systems, copy data to a log file, and remove the original data files.', '[Melcoz] has been distributed through an AutoIt loader script.', 'For [Operation Spalax] the threat actors used Nullsoft Scriptable Install System (NSIS) scripts to install malware.', '[CHOPSTICK] is capable of performing remote command execution.', '[Donut] can generate shellcode outputs that execute via Ruby.\t', '[FIVEHANDS] can receive a command line argument to limit file encryption to specified directories.', '[FIN5] scans processes on all victim systems in the environment and uses automated scripts to pull back the results.', '[Matryoshka] is capable of providing Meterpreter shell access.', '[Imminent Monitor] has a CommandPromptPacket and ScriptPacket module(s) for creating a remote shell and executing scripts.', '[Kessel] can create a reverse shell between the infected host and a specified system.\t', '[APT19] downloaded and launched code within a SCT file.', '[gh0st RAT] is able to open a remote shell to execute commands.', '[APT32] has used COM scriptlets to download Cobalt Strike beacons.\t', '[Dragonfly] has used the command line for execution.', '[P.A.S.

T1083,File and Directory Discovery,"Adversaries may enumerate files and directories or may search in specific locations of a host or network share for certain information within a file system. Adversaries may use the information from [File and Directory Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.  Many command shell utilities can be used to obtain this information. Examples include <code>dir</code>, <code>tree</code>, <code>ls</code>, <code>find</code>, and <code>locate</code>. Custom tools may also be used to gather file and directory information and interact with the [Native API] Adversaries may also leverage a [Network Device CLI] on network devices to gather file and directory information (e.g. <code>dir</code>, <code>show flash</code>, and/or <code>nvram</code>).","['[BLACKCOFFEE] has the capability to enumerate files.', '[Orz] can gather victim drive information.', '[Attor] has a plugin that enumerates files with specific extensions on all hard disk drives and stores file information in encrypted log files.', '[USBStealer] searches victim drives for files matching certain extensions (“.skr”,“.pkr” or “.key”) or names.', '[SDBbot] has the ability to get directory listings or drive information on a compromised host.', '[Kinsing] has used the find command to search for specific files.', '[Amadey] has searched for folders associated with antivirus software.', '[Woody RAT] can list all files and their associated attributes, including filename, type, owner, creation time, last access time, last write time, size, and permissions.

T1497,Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,"Adversaries may employ various means to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments. This may include changing behaviors based on the results of checks for the presence of artifacts indicative of a virtual machine environment (VME) or sandbox. If the adversary detects a VME, they may alter their malware to disengage from the victim or conceal the core functions of the implant. They may also search for VME artifacts before dropping secondary or additional payloads. Adversaries may use the information learned from [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors.  Adversaries may use several methods to accomplish [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion] such as checking for security monitoring tools (e.g., Sysinternals, Wireshark, etc.) or other system artifacts associated with analysis or virtualization. Adversaries may also check for legitimate user activity to help determine if it is in an analysis environment. Additional methods include use of sleep timers or loops within malware code to avoid operating within a temporary sandbox.

T1608,Stage Capabilities,"Adversaries may upload, install, or otherwise set up capabilities that can be used during targeting. To support their operations, an adversary may need to take capabilities they developed ([Develop Capabilities] or obtained ([Obtain Capabilities] and stage them on infrastructure under their control. These capabilities may be staged on infrastructure that was previously purchased/rented by the adversary ([Acquire Infrastructure] or was otherwise compromised by them ([Compromise Infrastructure] Capabilities may also be staged on web services, such as GitHub or Pastebin, or on Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings that enable users to easily provision applications.  Staging of capabilities can aid the adversary in a number of initial access and post-compromise behaviors, including (but not limited to):  * Staging web resources necessary to conduct [Drive-by Compromise] when a user browses to a site. * Staging web resources for a link target to be used with spearphishing. * Uploading malware or tools to a location accessible to a victim network to enable [Ingress Tool Transfer] * Installing a previously acquired SSL/TLS certificate to use to encrypt command and control traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography] with [Web Protocols]",['[Mustang Panda] has used servers under their control to validate tracking pixels sent to phishing victims.']
T1480,Execution Guardrails,"Adversaries may use execution guardrails to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied and environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target. Guardrails ensure that a payload only executes against an intended target and reduces collateral damage from an adversary’s campaign. Values an adversary can provide about a target system or environment to use as guardrails may include specific network share names, attached physical devices, files, joined Active Directory (AD) domains, and local/external IP addresses.  Guardrails can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within. This use of guardrails is distinct from typical [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion] While use of [Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion] may involve checking for known sandbox values and continuing with execution only if there is no match, the use of guardrails will involve checking for an expected target-specific value and only continuing with execution if there is such a match.","[""[DEADEYE] can ensure it executes only on intended systems by identifying the victim's volume serial number, hostname, and/or DNS domain."", '[Anchor] can terminate itself if specific execution flags are not present.', '[BitPaymer] compares file names and paths to a list of excluded names and directory names during encryption.', '[VaporRage] has the ability to check for the presence of a specific DLL and terminate if it is not found.', '[EnvyScout] can call <code>window.location.pathname</code> to ensure that embedded files are being executed from the C: drive, and will terminate if they are not.', ""[Torisma] is only delivered to a compromised host if the victim's IP address is on an allow-list."", '[Small Sieve] can only execute correctly if the word `Platypus` is passed to it on the command line.', '[Stuxnet] checks for specific operating systems on 32-bit machines, Registry keys, and dates for vulnerabilities, and will exit execution if the values are not met.', '[SUNSPOT] only replaces SolarWinds Orion source code if the MD5 checksums of both the original source code file and backdoored replacement source code match hardcoded values.

T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.  Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service (SaaS). OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. Adversaries who steal account API tokens in cloud and containerized environments may be able to access data and perform actions with the permissions of these accounts, which can lead to privilege escalation and further compromise of the environment.  In Kubernetes environments, processes running inside a container communicate with the Kubernetes API server using service account tokens. If a container is compromised, an attacker may be able to steal the container’s token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API commands.  Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be required to grant access. An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols. An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow. An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials.    Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token. The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls. Then, they can send a [Spearphishing Link] to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application. Once the OAuth access token is granted, the application can gain potentially long-term access to features of the user account through [Application Access Token]  Application access tokens may function within a limited lifetime, limiting how long an adversary can utilize the stolen token. However, in some cases, adversaries can also steal application refresh tokens, allowing them to obtain new access tokens without prompting the user.    ","['[Peirates] gathers Kubernetes service account tokens using a variety of techniques.', '[AADInternals] can steal users’ access tokens via phishing emails containing malicious links.', '[APT28] has used several malicious applications to steal user OAuth access tokens including applications masquerading as ""Google Defender"" ""Google Email Protection,"" and ""Google Scanner"" for Gmail users. They also targeted Yahoo users with applications masquerading as ""Delivery Service"" and ""McAfee Email Protection"".']"
T1204,User Execution,"An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution. Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link. These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of [Phishing]  While [User Execution] frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it. This activity may also be seen shortly after [Internal Spearphishing]  Adversaries may also deceive users into performing actions such as enabling [Remote Access Software] allowing direct control of the system to the adversary, or downloading and executing malware for [User Execution] For example, tech support scams can be facilitated through [Phishing] vishing, or various forms of user interaction. Adversaries can use a combination of these methods, such as spoofing and promoting toll-free numbers or call centers that are used to direct victims to malicious websites, to deliver and execute payloads containing malware or [Remote Access Software]","['[LAPSUS$] has recruited target organization employees or contractors who provide credentials and approve an associated MFA prompt, or install remote management software onto a corporate workstation, allowing [LAPSUS$] to take control of an authenticated system.', '[Magic Hound] has attempted to get users to execute malware via social media and spearphishing emails.']"
T1057,Process Discovery,"Adversaries may attempt to get information about running processes on a system. Information obtained could be used to gain an understanding of common software/applications running on systems within the network. Adversaries may use the information from [Process Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.  In Windows environments, adversaries could obtain details on running processes using the [Tasklist] utility via [cmd] or <code>Get-Process</code> via [PowerShell] Information about processes can also be extracted from the output of [Native API] calls such as <code>CreateToolhelp32Snapshot</code>. In Mac and Linux, this is accomplished with the <code>ps</code> command. Adversaries may also opt to enumerate processes via /proc.  On network devices, [Network Device CLI] commands such as `show processes` can be used to display current running processes.","['[Epic] uses the <code>tasklist /v</code> command to obtain a list of processes.', '[WarzoneRAT] can obtain a list of processes on a compromised host.', '[FELIXROOT] collects a list of running processes.', 'During [Frankenstein] the threat actors used [Empire] to obtain a list of all running processes.', '[Windshift] has used malware to enumerate active processes.', '[SUNSPOT] monitored running processes for instances of <code>MsBuild.exe</code> by hashing the name of each running process and comparing it to the corresponding value <code>0x53D525</code>.

T1554,Compromise Client Software Binary,"Adversaries may modify client software binaries to establish persistent access to systems. Client software enables users to access services provided by a server. Common client software types are SSH clients, FTP clients, email clients, and web browsers.  Adversaries may make modifications to client software binaries to carry out malicious tasks when those applications are in use. For example, an adversary may copy source code for the client software, add a backdoor, compile for the target, and replace the legitimate application binary (or support files) with the backdoored one. An adversary may also modify an existing binary by patching in malicious functionality (e.g., IAT Hooking/Entry point patching) prior to the binary’s legitimate execution. For example, an adversary may modify the entry point of a binary to point to malicious code patched in by the adversary before resuming normal execution flow.  Since these applications may be routinely executed by the user, the adversary can leverage this for persistent access to the host.","['[Industroyer] has used a Trojanized version of the Windows Notepad application for an additional backdoor persistence mechanism.', '[Kobalos] replaced the SSH client with a trojanized SSH client to steal credentials on compromised systems.', '[Kessel] has maliciously altered the OpenSSH binary on targeted systems to create a backdoor.', '[ThiefQuest] searches through the <code>/Users/</code> folder looking for executable files.

T1212,Exploitation for Credential Access,"Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to collect credentials. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code.   Credentialing and authentication mechanisms may be targeted for exploitation by adversaries as a means to gain access to useful credentials or circumvent the process to gain authenticated access to systems. One example of this is `MS14-068`, which targets Kerberos and can be used to forge Kerberos tickets using domain user permissions. Another example of this is replay attacks, in which the adversary intercepts data packets sent between parties and then later replays these packets. If services don't properly validate authentication requests, these replayed packets may allow an adversary to impersonate one of the parties and gain unauthorized access or privileges.  Such exploitation has been demonstrated in cloud environments as well. For example, adversaries have exploited vulnerabilities in public cloud infrastructure that allowed for unintended authentication token creation and renewal.  Exploitation for credential access may also result in Privilege Escalation depending on the process targeted or credentials obtained.",[]
T1210,Exploitation of Remote Services,"Adversaries may exploit remote services to gain unauthorized access to internal systems once inside of a network. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. A common goal for post-compromise exploitation of remote services is for lateral movement to enable access to a remote system.  An adversary may need to determine if the remote system is in a vulnerable state, which may be done through [Network Service Discovery] or other Discovery methods looking for common, vulnerable software that may be deployed in the network, the lack of certain patches that may indicate vulnerabilities,  or security software that may be used to detect or contain remote exploitation. Servers are likely a high value target for lateral movement exploitation, but endpoint systems may also be at risk if they provide an advantage or access to additional resources.  There are several well-known vulnerabilities that exist in common services such as SMB  and RDP  as well as applications that may be used within internal networks such as MySQL  and web server services.  Depending on the permissions level of the vulnerable remote service an adversary may achieve [Exploitation for Privilege Escalation] as a result of lateral movement exploitation as well.","['[Flame] can use MS10-061 to exploit a print spooler vulnerability in a remote system with a shared printer in order to move laterally.', '[WannaCry] uses an exploit in SMBv1 to spread itself to other remote systems on a network.', '[Wizard Spider] has exploited or attempted to exploit Zerologon (CVE-2020-1472) and EternalBlue (MS17-010) vulnerabilities.', '[Fox Kitten] has exploited known vulnerabilities in remote services including RDP.', '[Earth Lusca] has used [Mimikatz] to exploit a domain controller via the ZeroLogon exploit (CVE-2020-1472).', '[Stuxnet] propagates using the MS10-061 Print Spooler and MS08-067 Windows Server Service vulnerabilities.', '[QakBot] can move laterally using worm-like functionality through exploitation of SMB.', '[Emotet] has been seen exploiting SMB via a vulnerability exploit like EternalBlue (MS17-010) to achieve lateral movement and propagation.

T1149,LC_MAIN Hijacking,"**This technique has been deprecated and should no longer be used.**  As of OS X 10.8, mach-O binaries introduced a new header called LC_MAIN that points to the binary’s entry point for execution. Previously, there were two headers to achieve this same effect: LC_THREAD and LC_UNIXTHREAD  . The entry point for a binary can be hijacked so that initial execution flows to a malicious addition (either another section or a code cave) and then goes back to the initial entry point so that the victim doesn’t know anything was different  . By modifying a binary in this way, application whitelisting can be bypassed because the file name or application path is still the same.",[]
T1098,Account Manipulation,"Adversaries may manipulate accounts to maintain and/or elevate access to victim systems. Account manipulation may consist of any action that preserves or modifies adversary access to a compromised account, such as modifying credentials or permission groups. These actions could also include account activity designed to subvert security policies, such as performing iterative password updates to bypass password duration policies and preserve the life of compromised credentials.   In order to create or manipulate accounts, the adversary must already have sufficient permissions on systems or the domain. However, account manipulation may also lead to privilege escalation where modifications grant access to additional roles, permissions, or higher-privileged [Valid Accounts]","['[Lazarus Group] malware WhiskeyDelta-Two contains a function that attempts to rename the administrator’s account.', '[SMOKEDHAM] has added user accounts to local Admin groups.', '[APT41] has added user accounts to the User and Admin groups.

Phishing can be targeted, known as spearphishing. In spearphishing, a specific individual, company, or industry will be targeted by the adversary. More generally, adversaries can conduct non-targeted phishing, such as in mass malware spam campaigns.  Adversaries may send victims emails containing malicious attachments or links, typically to execute malicious code on victim systems. Phishing may also be conducted via third-party services, like social media platforms. Phishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source, as well as evasive techniques such as removing or manipulating emails or metadata/headers from compromised accounts being abused to send messages (e.g., [Email Hiding Rules] Another way to accomplish this is by forging or spoofing the identity of the sender which can be used to fool both the human recipient as well as automated security tools.   Victims may also receive phishing messages that instruct them to call a phone number where they are directed to visit a malicious URL, download malware, or install adversary-accessible remote management tools onto their computer (i.e., [User Execution]","['[Hikit] has been spread through spear phishing.', '[Axiom] has used spear phishing to initially compromise victims.', '[Royal] has been spread through the use of phishing campaigns including ""call back phishing"" where victims are lured into calling a number provided through email.', ""[GOLD SOUTHFIELD] has conducted malicious spam (malspam) campaigns to gain access to victim's machines."", '[Dragonfly] has used spearphising campaigns to gain access to victims.']"
T1110,Brute Force,"Adversaries may use brute force techniques to gain access to accounts when passwords are unknown or when password hashes are obtained. Without knowledge of the password for an account or set of accounts, an adversary may systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. Brute forcing passwords can take place via interaction with a service that will check the validity of those credentials or offline against previously acquired credential data, such as password hashes.  Brute forcing credentials may take place at various points during a breach. For example, adversaries may attempt to brute force access to [Valid Accounts] within a victim environment leveraging knowledge gathered from other post-compromise behaviors such as [OS Credential Dumping] [Account Discovery] or [Password Policy Discovery] Adversaries may also combine brute forcing activity with behaviors such as [External Remote Services] as part of Initial Access.","['[Fox Kitten] has brute forced RDP credentials.', '[HEXANE] has used brute force attacks to compromise valid credentials.', '[Chaos] conducts brute force attacks against SSH services to gain initial access.', '[Caterpillar WebShell] has a module to perform brute force attacks on a system.

T1565,Data Manipulation,"Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data in order to influence external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, or decision making.  The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.",['[FIN13] has injected fraudulent transactions into compromised networks that mimic legitimate behavior to siphon off incremental amounts of money.']
T1574,Hijack Execution Flow,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the way operating systems run programs. Hijacking execution flow can be for the purposes of persistence, since this hijacked execution may reoccur over time. Adversaries may also use these mechanisms to elevate privileges or evade defenses, such as application control or other restrictions on execution.  There are many ways an adversary may hijack the flow of execution, including by manipulating how the operating system locates programs to be executed. How the operating system locates libraries to be used by a program can also be intercepted. Locations where the operating system looks for programs/resources, such as file directories and in the case of Windows the Registry, could also be poisoned to include malicious payloads.","['One of [Dtrack] can replace the normal flow of a program execution with malicious code.', '[ShimRat] can hijack the cryptbase.dll within migwiz.exe to escalate privileges and bypass UAC controls.', '[Denis] replaces the nonexistent Windows DLL ""msfte.dll"" with its own malicious version, which is loaded by the SearchIndexer.exe and SearchProtocolHost.exe.', 'During [C0017] [APT41] established persistence by loading malicious libraries via modifications to the Import Address Table (IAT) within legitimate Microsoft binaries. ']"
T1078,Valid Accounts,"Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of existing accounts as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on systems within the network and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems and externally available services, such as VPNs, Outlook Web Access, network devices, and remote desktop. Compromised credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide to make it harder to detect their presence.  In some cases, adversaries may abuse inactive accounts: for example, those belonging to individuals who are no longer part of an organization. Using these accounts may allow the adversary to evade detection, as the original account user will not be present to identify any anomalous activity taking place on their account.  The overlap of permissions for local, domain, and cloud accounts across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator) to bypass access controls set within the enterprise.","['[APT41] used compromised credentials to log on to other systems.', '[FIN8] has used valid accounts for persistence and lateral movement.', '[FIN4] has used legitimate credentials to hijack email communications.', '[FIN7] has harvested valid administrative credentials for lateral movement.', '[Kinsing] has used valid SSH credentials to access remote hosts.', '[Dragonfly] has compromised user credentials and used valid accounts for operations.', '[GALLIUM] leveraged valid accounts to maintain access to a victim network.', '[APT18] actors leverage legitimate credentials to log into external remote services.', '[Lazarus Group] has used administrator credentials to gain access to restricted network segments.', '[Chimera] has used a valid account to maintain persistence via scheduled task.', 'Some [SeaDuke] samples have a module to extract email from Microsoft Exchange servers using compromised credentials.', '[Dtrack] used hard-coded credentials to gain access to a network share.', '[Industroyer] can use supplied user credentials to execute processes and stop services.', 'During [Night Dragon] threat actors used compromised VPN accounts to gain access to victim systems.', '[menuPass] has used valid accounts including shared between Managed Service Providers and clients to move between the two environments.', 'Adversaries can instruct [Duqu] to spread laterally by copying itself to shares it has enumerated and for which it has obtained legitimate credentials (via keylogging or other means).

T1068,Exploitation for Privilege Escalation,"Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in an attempt to elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructs such as permission levels will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques, so adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.  When initially gaining access to a system, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and software commonly running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user level permissions to SYSTEM or root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable. This could also enable an adversary to move from a virtualized environment, such as within a virtual machine or container, onto the underlying host. This may be a necessary step for an adversary compromising an endpoint system that has been properly configured and limits other privilege escalation methods.  Adversaries may bring a signed vulnerable driver onto a compromised machine so that they can exploit the vulnerability to execute code in kernel mode. This process is sometimes referred to as Bring Your Own Vulnerable Driver (BYOVD). Adversaries may include the vulnerable driver with files delivered during Initial Access or download it to a compromised system via [Ingress Tool Transfer] or [Lateral Tool Transfer]","['[Threat Group-3390] has used CVE-2014-6324 and CVE-2017-0213 to escalate privileges.', '[Remsec] has a plugin to drop and execute vulnerable Outpost Sandbox or avast!

T1531,Account Access Removal,"Adversaries may interrupt availability of system and network resources by inhibiting access to accounts utilized by legitimate users. Accounts may be deleted, locked, or manipulated (ex: changed credentials) to remove access to accounts. Adversaries may also subsequently log off and/or perform a [System Shutdown/Reboot] to set malicious changes into place.  In Windows, [Net] utility, <code>Set-LocalUser</code> and <code>Set-ADAccountPassword</code> [PowerShell] cmdlets may be used by adversaries to modify user accounts. In Linux, the <code>passwd</code> utility may be used to change passwords. Accounts could also be disabled by Group Policy.   Adversaries who use ransomware or similar attacks may first perform this and other Impact behaviors, such as [Data Destruction] and [Defacement] in order to impede incident response/recovery before completing the [Data Encrypted for Impact] objective.

T1546,Event Triggered Execution,"Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges using system mechanisms that trigger execution based on specific events. Various operating systems have means to monitor and subscribe to events such as logons or other user activity such as running specific applications/binaries. Cloud environments may also support various functions and services that monitor and can be invoked in response to specific cloud events.  Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms as a means of maintaining persistent access to a victim via repeatedly executing malicious code. After gaining access to a victim system, adversaries may create/modify event triggers to point to malicious content that will be executed whenever the event trigger is invoked.  Since the execution can be proxied by an account with higher permissions, such as SYSTEM or service accounts, an adversary may be able to abuse these triggered execution mechanisms to escalate their privileges. ","['[Pacu] can set up S3 bucket notifications to trigger a malicious Lambda function when a CloudFormation template is uploaded to the bucket. It can also create Lambda functions that trigger upon the creation of users, roles, and groups.']"
T1553,Subvert Trust Controls,"Adversaries may undermine security controls that will either warn users of untrusted activity or prevent execution of untrusted programs. Operating systems and security products may contain mechanisms to identify programs or websites as possessing some level of trust. Examples of such features would include a program being allowed to run because it is signed by a valid code signing certificate, a program prompting the user with a warning because it has an attribute set from being downloaded from the Internet, or getting an indication that you are about to connect to an untrusted site.  Adversaries may attempt to subvert these trust mechanisms. The method adversaries use will depend on the specific mechanism they seek to subvert. Adversaries may conduct [File and Directory Permissions Modification] or [Modify Registry] in support of subverting these controls. Adversaries may also create or steal code signing certificates to acquire trust on target systems. ",['[Axiom] has used digital certificates to deliver malware.']
T1203,Exploitation for Client Execution,"Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in client applications to execute code. Vulnerabilities can exist in software due to unsecure coding practices that can lead to unanticipated behavior. Adversaries can take advantage of certain vulnerabilities through targeted exploitation for the purpose of arbitrary code execution. Oftentimes the most valuable exploits to an offensive toolkit are those that can be used to obtain code execution on a remote system because they can be used to gain access to that system. Users will expect to see files related to the applications they commonly used to do work, so they are a useful target for exploit research and development because of their high utility.  Several types exist:  ### Browser-based Exploitation  Web browsers are a common target through [Drive-by Compromise] and [Spearphishing Link] Endpoint systems may be compromised through normal web browsing or from certain users being targeted by links in spearphishing emails to adversary controlled sites used to exploit the web browser. These often do not require an action by the user for the exploit to be executed.  ### Office Applications  Common office and productivity applications such as Microsoft Office are also targeted through [Phishing] Malicious files will be transmitted directly as attachments or through links to download them. These require the user to open the document or file for the exploit to run.  ### Common Third-party Applications  Other applications that are commonly seen or are part of the software deployed in a target network may also be used for exploitation. Applications such as Adobe Reader and Flash, which are common in enterprise environments, have been routinely targeted by adversaries attempting to gain access to systems. Depending on the software and nature of the vulnerability, some may be exploited in the browser or require the user to open a file. For instance, some Flash exploits have been delivered as objects within Microsoft Office documents.","['[Sidewinder] has exploited vulnerabilities to gain execution including CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2020-0674.', '[APT28] has exploited Microsoft Office vulnerability CVE-2017-0262 for execution.', '[Threat Group-3390] has exploited CVE-2018-0798 in Equation Editor.', '[Agent Tesla] has exploited Office vulnerabilities such as CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2017-8570 for execution during delivery.

T1499,Endpoint Denial of Service,"Adversaries may perform Endpoint Denial of Service (DoS) attacks to degrade or block the availability of services to users. Endpoint DoS can be performed by exhausting the system resources those services are hosted on or exploiting the system to cause a persistent crash condition. Example services include websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications. Adversaries have been observed conducting DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion.  An Endpoint DoS denies the availability of a service without saturating the network used to provide access to the service. Adversaries can target various layers of the application stack that is hosted on the system used to provide the service. These layers include the Operating Systems (OS), server applications such as web servers, DNS servers, databases, and the (typically web-based) applications that sit on top of them. Attacking each layer requires different techniques that take advantage of bottlenecks that are unique to the respective components. A DoS attack may be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS (DDoS).  To perform DoS attacks against endpoint resources, several aspects apply to multiple methods, including IP address spoofing and botnets.  Adversaries may use the original IP address of an attacking system, or spoof the source IP address to make the attack traffic more difficult to trace back to the attacking system or to enable reflection. This can increase the difficulty defenders have in defending against the attack by reducing or eliminating the effectiveness of filtering by the source address on network defense devices.  Botnets are commonly used to conduct DDoS attacks against networks and services. Large botnets can generate a significant amount of traffic from systems spread across the global internet. Adversaries may have the resources to build out and control their own botnet infrastructure or may rent time on an existing botnet to conduct an attack. In some of the worst cases for DDoS, so many systems are used to generate requests that each one only needs to send out a small amount of traffic to produce enough volume to exhaust the target's resources. In such circumstances, distinguishing DDoS traffic from legitimate clients becomes exceedingly difficult. Botnets have been used in some of the most high-profile DDoS attacks, such as the 2012 series of incidents that targeted major US banks.  In cases where traffic manipulation is used, there may be points in the global network (such as high traffic gateway routers) where packets can be altered and cause legitimate clients to execute code that directs network packets toward a target in high volume. This type of capability was previously used for the purposes of web censorship where client HTTP traffic was modified to include a reference to JavaScript that generated the DDoS code to overwhelm target web servers.  For attacks attempting to saturate the providing network, see [Network Denial of Service] ","['[OnionDuke] has the capability to use a Denial of Service module.', '[Sandworm Team] temporarily disrupted service to Georgian government, non-government, and private sector websites after compromising a Georgian web hosting provider in 2019.', '[ZxShell] has a feature to perform SYN flood attack on a host.

T1496,Resource Hijacking,"Adversaries may leverage the resources of co-opted systems to complete resource-intensive tasks, which may impact system and/or hosted service availability.   One common purpose for Resource Hijacking is to validate transactions of cryptocurrency networks and earn virtual currency. Adversaries may consume enough system resources to negatively impact and/or cause affected machines to become unresponsive. Servers and cloud-based systems are common targets because of the high potential for available resources, but user endpoint systems may also be compromised and used for Resource Hijacking and cryptocurrency mining. Containerized environments may also be targeted due to the ease of deployment via exposed APIs and the potential for scaling mining activities by deploying or compromising multiple containers within an environment or cluster.  Additionally, some cryptocurrency mining malware identify then kill off processes for competing malware to ensure it’s not competing for resources.  Adversaries may also use malware that leverages a system's network bandwidth as part of a botnet in order to facilitate [Network Denial of Service] campaigns and/or to seed malicious torrents. Alternatively, they may engage in proxyjacking by selling use of the victims' network bandwidth and IP address to proxyware services.","['[Lucifer] can use system resources to mine cryptocurrency, dropping XMRig to mine Monero.', '[Skidmap] is a kernel-mode rootkit used for cryptocurrency mining.', '[CookieMiner] has loaded coinmining software onto systems to mine for Koto cryptocurrency.

T1213,Data from Information Repositories,"Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information. Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information. Adversaries may also abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization.   The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository:  * Policies, procedures, and standards * Physical / logical network diagrams * System architecture diagrams * Technical system documentation * Testing / development credentials * Work / project schedules * Source code snippets * Links to network shares and other internal resources  Information stored in a repository may vary based on the specific instance or environment.

Adversaries may install malicious components to extend and abuse server applications.,[]
T1485,Data Destruction,"Adversaries may destroy data and files on specific systems or in large numbers on a network to interrupt availability to systems, services, and network resources. Data destruction is likely to render stored data irrecoverable by forensic techniques through overwriting files or data on local and remote drives. Common operating system file deletion commands such as <code>del</code> and <code>rm</code> often only remove pointers to files without wiping the contents of the files themselves, making the files recoverable by proper forensic methodology. This behavior is distinct from [Disk Content Wipe] and [Disk Structure Wipe] because individual files are destroyed rather than sections of a storage disk or the disk's logical structure.  Adversaries may attempt to overwrite files and directories with randomly generated data to make it irrecoverable. In some cases politically oriented image files have been used to overwrite data.  To maximize impact on the target organization in operations where network-wide availability interruption is the goal, malware designed for destroying data may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging additional techniques like [Valid Accounts] [OS Credential Dumping] and [SMB/Windows Admin Shares]  In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage access to delete cloud storage, cloud storage accounts, machine images, and other infrastructure crucial to operations to damage an organization or their customers.","['[Diavol] can delete specified files from a targeted system.', '[WhisperGate] can corrupt files by overwriting the first 1 MB with `0xcc` and appending random extensions.', '[Industroyer] data wiper module clears registry keys and overwrites both ICS configuration and Windows files.', ""[LAPSUS$] has deleted the target's systems and resources both on-premises and in the cloud."", '[Xbash] has destroyed Linux-based databases as part of its ransomware capabilities.\t', '[Lazarus Group] has used a custom secure delete function to overwrite file contents with data from heap memory.', '[REvil] has the capability to destroy files and folders.', '[Kazuar] can overwrite files with random data before deleting them.', '[HermeticWiper] can recursively wipe folders and files in `Windows`, `Program Files`, `Program Files(x86)`, `PerfLogs`, `Boot, System`, `Volume Information`, and `AppData` folders using `FSCTL_MOVE_FILE`.

T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring [Application Access Token]  Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist (i.e., [Drive-by Target] including:  * A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting * Script files served to a legitimate website from a publicly writeable cloud storage bucket are modified by an adversary * Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers (i.e., [Malvertising] * Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client (e.g. forum posts, comments, and other user controllable web content).  Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. There are several known examples of this occurring.  Typical drive-by compromise process:  1. A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content. 2. Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version.      * The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes. 3. Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser. 4. If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place.     * In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.  Unlike [Exploit Public-Facing Application] the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website. This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.  Adversaries may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed to [Steal Application Access Token] like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information. These malicious applications have been delivered through popups on legitimate websites.","['[Transparent Tribe] has used websites with malicious hyperlinks and iframes to infect targeted victims with [Crimson] [njRAT] and other malicious tools.', '[RTM] has distributed its malware via the RIG and SUNDOWN exploit kits, as well as online advertising network <code>Yandex.Direct</code>.', '[PLATINUM] has sometimes used drive-by attacks against vulnerable browser plugins.', '[Windshift] has used compromised websites to register custom URL schemes on a remote system.', '[KARAE] was distributed through torrent file-sharing websites to South Korean victims, using a YouTube video downloader application as a lure.', '[Earth Lusca] has performed watering hole attacks.', '[APT38] has conducted watering holes schemes to gain initial access to victims.', '[Bundlore] has been spread through malicious advertisements on websites.', '[Axiom] has used watering hole attacks to gain access.', '[APT19] performed a watering hole attack on forbes.com in 2014 to compromise targets.', '[Darkhotel] used embedded iframes on hotel login portals to redirect selected victims to download malware.', '[Andariel] has used watering hole attacks, often with zero-day exploits, to gain initial access to victims within a specific IP range.', '[APT28] has compromised targets via strategic web compromise utilizing custom exploit kits.', '[Dragonfly] has compromised targets via strategic web compromise (SWC) utilizing a custom exploit kit.', '[Bad Rabbit] spread through watering holes on popular sites by injecting JavaScript into the HTML body or a <code>.js</code> file.', '[Dark Caracal] leveraged a watering hole to serve up malicious code.', '[Turla] has infected victims using watering holes.', '[Patchwork] has used watering holes to deliver files with exploits to initial victims.', '[Leviathan] has infected victims using watering holes.', '[APT32] has infected victims by tricking them into visiting compromised watering hole websites.', '[BRONZE BUTLER] compromised three Japanese websites using a Flash exploit to perform watering hole attacks.', 'During [Operation Dust Storm] the threat actors used a watering hole attack on a popular software reseller to exploit the then-zero-day Internet Explorer vulnerability CVE-2014-0322.', '[Lazarus Group] delivered [RATANKBA] and other malicious code to victims via a compromised legitimate website.', '[Threat Group-3390] has extensively used strategic web compromises to target victims.', 'During [C0010] UNC3890 actors likely established a watering hole that was hosted on a login page of a legitimate Israeli shipping company that was active until at least November 2021.', '[LoudMiner] is typically bundled with pirated copies of Virtual Studio Technology (VST) for Windows and macOS.', '[Elderwood] has delivered zero-day exploits and malware to victims by injecting malicious code into specific public Web pages visited by targets within a particular sector.', '[REvil] has infected victim machines through compromised websites and exploit kits.', ""[APT37] has used strategic web compromises, particularly of South Korean websites, to distribute malware.

T1134,Access Token Manipulation,"Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls. Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process. A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process. When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token.  An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing. These token can then be applied to an existing process (i.e. [Token Impersonation/Theft] or used to spawn a new process (i.e. [Create Process with Token] An adversary must already be in a privileged user context (i.e. administrator) to steal a token. However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level. An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.  Any standard user can use the <code>runas</code> command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account. There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens.","['[HermeticWiper] can use `AdjustTokenPrivileges` to grant itself privileges for debugging with `SeDebugPrivilege`, creating backups with `SeBackupPrivilege`, loading drivers with `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and shutting down a local system with `SeShutdownPrivilege`.', '[SUNSPOT] modified its security token to grants itself debugging privileges by adding <code>SeDebugPrivilege</code>.', '[PowerSploit] <code>Invoke-TokenManipulation</code> Exfiltration module can be used to manipulate tokens.', '[AppleSeed] can gain system level privilege by passing <code>SeDebugPrivilege</code> to the <code>AdjustTokenPrivilege</code> API.', '[Sliver] has the ability to manipulate user tokens on targeted Windows systems.', '[FIN6] has used has used Metasploit’s named-pipe impersonation technique to escalate privileges.', '[Blue Mockingbird] has used JuicyPotato to abuse the <code>SeImpersonate</code> token privilege to escalate from web application pool accounts to NT Authority\\SYSTEM.', '[SslMM] contains a feature to manipulate process privileges and tokens.', '[Duqu] examines running system processes for tokens that have specific system privileges.

T1136,Create Account,"Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems. With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system.  Accounts may be created on the local system or within a domain or cloud tenant. In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection.","['[Indrik Spider] used <code>wmic.exe</code> to add a new user to the system.', 'During the [2016 Ukraine Electric Power Attack] [Sandworm Team] added a login to a SQL Server with `sp_addlinkedsrvlogin`.', '[Sandworm Team] added a login to a SQL Server with <code>sp_addlinkedsrvlogin</code>.', 'Dragonfly created accounts that appeared to be tailored to each individual staging target.']"
T1046,Network Service Discovery,"Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of services running on remote hosts and local network infrastructure devices, including those that may be vulnerable to remote software exploitation. Common methods to acquire this information include port and/or vulnerability scans using tools that are brought onto a system.     Within cloud environments, adversaries may attempt to discover services running on other cloud hosts. Additionally, if the cloud environment is connected to a on-premises environment, adversaries may be able to identify services running on non-cloud systems as well.  Within macOS environments, adversaries may use the native Bonjour application to discover services running on other macOS hosts within a network. The Bonjour mDNSResponder daemon automatically registers and advertises a host’s registered services on the network. For example, adversaries can use a mDNS query (such as <code>dns-sd -B _ssh._tcp .</code>) to find other systems broadcasting the ssh service.","['[Pupy] has a built-in module for port scanning.', '[APT39] has used [CrackMapExec] and a custom port scanner known as BLUETORCH for network scanning.', 'During [CostaRicto] the threat actors employed nmap and pscan to scan target environments.

Adversaries may also abuse installers and package managers, such as `yum` or `winget`, to download tools to victim hosts.  Files can also be transferred using various [Web Service] as well as native or otherwise present tools on the victim system. In some cases, adversaries may be able to leverage services that sync between a web-based and an on-premises client, such as Dropbox or OneDrive, to transfer files onto victim systems.

T1211,Exploitation for Defense Evasion,"Adversaries may exploit a system or application vulnerability to bypass security features. Exploitation of a vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in defensive security software that can be used to disable or circumvent them.  Adversaries may have prior knowledge through reconnaissance that security software exists within an environment or they may perform checks during or shortly after the system is compromised for [Security Software Discovery] The security software will likely be targeted directly for exploitation. There are examples of antivirus software being targeted by persistent threat groups to avoid detection.  There have also been examples of vulnerabilities in public cloud infrastructure of SaaS applications that may bypass defense boundaries , evade security logs , or deploy hidden infrastructure.",['[APT28] has used CVE-2015-4902 to bypass security features.']
T1529,System Shutdown/Reboot,"Adversaries may shutdown/reboot systems to interrupt access to, or aid in the destruction of, those systems. Operating systems may contain commands to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a machine or network device. In some cases, these commands may also be used to initiate a shutdown/reboot of a remote computer or network device via [Network Device CLI] (e.g. <code>reload</code>).  Shutting down or rebooting systems may disrupt access to computer resources for legitimate users while also impeding incident response/recovery.  Adversaries may attempt to shutdown/reboot a system after impacting it in other ways, such as [Disk Structure Wipe] or [Inhibit System Recovery] to hasten the intended effects on system availability.","['[DCSrv] has a function to sleep for two hours before rebooting the system.', '[LockerGoga] has been observed shutting down infected systems.', '[Olympic Destroyer] will shut down the compromised system after it is done modifying system configuration settings.', ""[APT38] has used a custom MBR wiper named BOOTWRECK, which will initiate a system reboot after wiping the victim's MBR."", '[Maze] has issued a shutdown command on a victim machine that, upon reboot, will run the ransomware within a VM.', '[APT37] has used malware that will issue the command <code>shutdown /r /t 1</code> to reboot a system after wiping its MBR.', '[LookBack] can shutdown and reboot the victim machine.', '[WhisperGate] can shutdown a compromised host through execution of `ExitWindowsEx` with the `EXW_SHUTDOWN` flag.', '[KillDisk] attempts to reboot the machine by terminating specific processes.', '[NotPetya] will reboot the system one hour after infection.', '[Lazarus Group] has rebooted systems after destroying files and wiping the MBR on infected systems.', '[Shamoon] will reboot the infected system once the wiping functionality has been completed.\t', '[HermeticWiper] can initiate a system shutdown.', '[AvosLocker] Linux variant has terminated ESXi virtual machines.', '[DustySky] can shutdown the infected machine.']"
T1053.005,Scheduled Task,"Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code. There are multiple ways to access the Task Scheduler in Windows. The [schtasks] utility can be run directly on the command line, or the Task Scheduler can be opened through the GUI within the Administrator Tools section of the Control Panel. In some cases, adversaries have used a .NET wrapper for the Windows Task Scheduler, and alternatively, adversaries have used the Windows netapi32 library to create a scheduled task.  The deprecated [at] utility could also be abused by adversaries (ex: [At] though <code>at.exe</code> can not access tasks created with <code>schtasks</code> or the Control Panel.  An adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence. The Windows Task Scheduler can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account (such as SYSTEM). Similar to [System Binary Proxy Execution] adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes.  Adversaries may also create ""hidden"" scheduled tasks (i.e. [Hide Artifacts] that may not be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks. Specifically, an adversary may hide a task from `schtasks /query` and the Task Scheduler by deleting the associated Security Descriptor (SD) registry value (where deletion of this value must be completed using SYSTEM permissions). Adversaries may also employ alternate methods to hide tasks, such as altering the metadata (e.g., `Index` value) within associated registry keys.

T1110.001,Password Guessing,"Adversaries with no prior knowledge of legitimate credentials within the system or environment may guess passwords to attempt access to accounts. Without knowledge of the password for an account, an adversary may opt to systematically guess the password using a repetitive or iterative mechanism. An adversary may guess login credentials without prior knowledge of system or environment passwords during an operation by using a list of common passwords. Password guessing may or may not take into account the target's policies on password complexity or use policies that may lock accounts out after a number of failed attempts.  Guessing passwords can be a risky option because it could cause numerous authentication failures and account lockouts, depending on the organization's login failure policies.   Typically, management services over commonly used ports are used when guessing passwords. Commonly targeted services include the following:  * SSH (22/TCP) * Telnet (23/TCP) * FTP (21/TCP) * NetBIOS / SMB / Samba (139/TCP & 445/TCP) * LDAP (389/TCP) * Kerberos (88/TCP) * RDP / Terminal Services (3389/TCP) * HTTP/HTTP Management Services (80/TCP & 443/TCP) * MSSQL (1433/TCP) * Oracle (1521/TCP) * MySQL (3306/TCP) * VNC (5900/TCP) * SNMP (161/UDP and 162/TCP/UDP)  In addition to management services, adversaries may ""target single sign-on (SSO) and cloud-based applications utilizing federated authentication protocols,"" as well as externally facing email applications, such as Office 365.. Further, adversaries may abuse network device interfaces (such as `wlanAPI`) to brute force accessible wifi-router(s) via wireless authentication protocols.  In default environments, LDAP and Kerberos connection attempts are less likely to trigger events over SMB, which creates Windows ""logon failure"" event ID 4625.","['[China Chopper] server component can perform brute force password guessing against authentication portals.', '[Emotet] has been observed using a hard coded list of passwords to brute force user accounts.

T1491.002,External Defacement,"An adversary may deface systems external to an organization in an attempt to deliver messaging, intimidate, or otherwise mislead an organization or users. [External Defacement] may ultimately cause users to distrust the systems and to question/discredit the system’s integrity. Externally-facing websites are a common victim of defacement; often targeted by adversary and hacktivist groups in order to push a political message or spread propaganda. [External Defacement] may be used as a catalyst to trigger events, or as a response to actions taken by an organization or government. Similarly, website defacement may also be used as setup, or a precursor, for future attacks such as [Drive-by Compromise]","['[Sandworm Team] defaced approximately 15,000 websites belonging to Georgian government, non-government, and private sector organizations in 2019.']"
T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,"Adversaries may launch a denial of service (DoS) attack targeting an endpoint's operating system (OS). A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity. These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.  Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods. With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed. Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server.  ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol. A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target. This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established. Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists. When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets. This greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.",[]
T1059.007,JavaScript,"Adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript for execution. JavaScript (JS) is a platform-independent scripting language (compiled just-in-time at runtime) commonly associated with scripts in webpages, though JS can be executed in runtime environments outside the browser.  JScript is the Microsoft implementation of the same scripting standard. JScript is interpreted via the Windows Script engine and thus integrated with many components of Windows such as the [Component Object Model] and Internet Explorer HTML Application (HTA) pages.  JavaScript for Automation (JXA) is a macOS scripting language based on JavaScript, included as part of Apple’s Open Scripting Architecture (OSA), that was introduced in OSX 10.10. Apple’s OSA provides scripting capabilities to control applications, interface with the operating system, and bridge access into the rest of Apple’s internal APIs. As of OSX 10.10, OSA only supports two languages, JXA and [AppleScript] Scripts can be executed via the command line utility <code>osascript</code>, they can be compiled into applications or script files via <code>osacompile</code>, and they can be compiled and executed in memory of other programs by leveraging the OSAKit Framework.  Adversaries may abuse various implementations of JavaScript to execute various behaviors. Common uses include hosting malicious scripts on websites as part of a [Drive-by Compromise] or downloading and executing these script files as secondary payloads.

T1548.002,Bypass User Account Control,"Adversaries may bypass UAC mechanisms to elevate process privileges on system. Windows User Account Control (UAC) allows a program to elevate its privileges (tracked as integrity levels ranging from low to high) to perform a task under administrator-level permissions, possibly by prompting the user for confirmation. The impact to the user ranges from denying the operation under high enforcement to allowing the user to perform the action if they are in the local administrators group and click through the prompt or allowing them to enter an administrator password to complete the action.  If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs can elevate privileges or execute some elevated [Component Object Model] objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box. An example of this is use of [Rundll32] to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated [Component Object Model] object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access. Malicious software may also be injected into a trusted process to gain elevated privileges without prompting a user.  Many methods have been discovered to bypass UAC. The Github readme page for UACME contains an extensive list of methods that have been discovered and implemented, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses. Additional bypass methods are regularly discovered and some used in the wild, such as:  * <code>eventvwr.exe</code> can auto-elevate and execute a specified binary or script.  Another bypass is possible through some lateral movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on remote systems and default to high integrity.","['[BlackEnergy] attempts to bypass default User Access Control (UAC) settings by exploiting a backward-compatibility setting found in Windows 7 and later.', '[RTM] can attempt to run the program as admin, then show a fake error message and a legitimate UAC bypass prompt to the user in an attempt to socially engineer the user into escalating privileges.', '[Cobalt Strike] can use a number of known techniques to bypass Windows UAC.', '[Gelsemium] can bypass UAC to elevate process privileges on a compromised host.', 'Many [ZeroT] samples can perform UAC bypass by using eventvwr.exe to execute a malicious file.', '[Saint Bot] has attempted to bypass UAC using `fodhelper.exe` to escalate privileges.', '[WarzoneRAT] can use `sdclt.exe` to bypass UAC in Windows 10 to escalate privileges; for older Windows versions [WarzoneRAT] can use the IFileOperation exploit to bypass the UAC module.', '[Pupy] can bypass Windows UAC through either DLL hijacking, eventvwr, or appPaths.', '[PoshC2] can utilize multiple methods to bypass UAC.', '[KONNI] has bypassed UAC by performing token impersonation as well as an RPC-based method, this included bypassing UAC set to “AlwaysNotify"".', '[Sakula] contains UAC bypass code for both 32- and 64-bit systems.', '[ShimRat] has hijacked the cryptbase.dll within migwiz.exe to escalate privileges.

T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges. Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.  Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo (sometimes referred to as ""superuser do"") allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system. The <code>sudo</code> command ""allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users (or groups of users) the ability to run some (or all) commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments."" Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a <code>timestamp_timeout</code>, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of <code>sudo</code> before it will re-prompt for a password. This is because <code>sudo</code> has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time. Sudo creates (or touches) a file at <code>/var/db/sudo</code> with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout. Additionally, there is a <code>tty_tickets</code> variable that treats each new tty (terminal session) in isolation. This means that, for example, the sudo timeout of one tty will not affect another tty (you will have to type the password again).  The sudoers file, <code>/etc/sudoers</code>, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals. This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups. This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password. However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like <code>user1 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL</code>. Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.  Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password. For example, <code>/var/db/sudo</code>'s timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the <code>timestamp_timeout</code> range. If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password. Additional, if <code>tty_tickets</code> is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user.

T1542.001,System Firmware,"Adversaries may modify system firmware to persist on systems.The BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) and The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) or Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI) are examples of system firmware that operate as the software interface between the operating system and hardware of a computer.     System firmware like BIOS and (U)EFI underly the functionality of a computer and may be modified by an adversary to perform or assist in malicious activity. Capabilities exist to overwrite the system firmware, which may give sophisticated adversaries a means to install malicious firmware updates as a means of persistence on a system that may be difficult to detect.","['[LoJax] is a UEFI BIOS rootkit deployed to persist remote access software on some targeted systems.

T1499.003,Application Exhaustion Flood,"Adversaries may target resource intensive features of applications to cause a denial of service (DoS), denying availability to those applications. For example, specific features in web applications may be highly resource intensive. Repeated requests to those features may be able to exhaust system resources and deny access to the application or the server itself.",[]
T1588.004,Digital Certificates,"Adversaries may buy and/or steal SSL/TLS certificates that can be used during targeting. SSL/TLS certificates are designed to instill trust. They include information about the key, information about its owner's identity, and the digital signature of an entity that has verified the certificate's contents are correct. If the signature is valid, and the person examining the certificate trusts the signer, then they know they can use that key to communicate with its owner.  Adversaries may purchase or steal SSL/TLS certificates to further their operations, such as encrypting C2 traffic (ex: [Asymmetric Cryptography] with [Web Protocols] or even enabling [Adversary-in-the-Middle] if the certificate is trusted or otherwise added to the root of trust (i.e. [Install Root Certificate] The purchase of digital certificates may be done using a front organization or using information stolen from a previously compromised entity that allows the adversary to validate to a certificate provider as that entity. Adversaries may also steal certificate materials directly from a compromised third-party, including from certificate authorities. Adversaries may register or hijack domains that they will later purchase an SSL/TLS certificate for.  Certificate authorities exist that allow adversaries to acquire SSL/TLS certificates, such as domain validation certificates, for free.  After obtaining a digital certificate, an adversary may then install that certificate (see [Install Digital Certificate] on infrastructure under their control.","[""[Silent Librarian] has obtained free Let's Encrypt SSL certificates for use on their phishing pages."", '[Lazarus Group] has obtained SSL certificates for their C2 domains.', 'For [Operation Honeybee] the threat actors stole a digital signature from Adobe Systems to use with their MaoCheng dropper.', '[LuminousMoth] has used a valid digital certificate for some of their malware.

T1036.005,Match Legitimate Name or Location,"Adversaries may match or approximate the name or location of legitimate files or resources when naming/placing them. This is done for the sake of evading defenses and observation. This may be done by placing an executable in a commonly trusted directory (ex: under System32) or giving it the name of a legitimate, trusted program (ex: svchost.exe). In containerized environments, this may also be done by creating a resource in a namespace that matches the naming convention of a container pod or cluster. Alternatively, a file or container image name given may be a close approximation to legitimate programs/images or something innocuous.

T1565.001,Stored Data Manipulation,"Adversaries may insert, delete, or manipulate data at rest in order to influence external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating stored data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.  Stored data could include a variety of file formats, such as Office files, databases, stored emails, and custom file formats. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the type of data as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary.

T1566.002,Spearphishing Link,"Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious link in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing with a link is a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of links to download malware contained in email, instead of attaching malicious files to the email itself, to avoid defenses that may inspect email attachments. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.  All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this case, the malicious emails contain links. Generally, the links will be accompanied by social engineering text and require the user to actively click or copy and paste a URL into a browser, leveraging [User Execution] The visited website may compromise the web browser using an exploit, or the user will be prompted to download applications, documents, zip files, or even executables depending on the pretext for the email in the first place.  Adversaries may also include links that are intended to interact directly with an email reader, including embedded images intended to exploit the end system directly. Additionally, adversaries may use seemingly benign links that abuse special characters to mimic legitimate websites (known as an ""IDN homograph attack""). URLs may also be obfuscated by taking advantage of quirks in the URL schema, such as the acceptance of integer- or hexadecimal-based hostname formats and the automatic discarding of text before an “@” symbol: for example, `hxxp://google.com@1157586937`.  Adversaries may also utilize links to perform consent phishing, typically with OAuth 2.0 request URLs that when accepted by the user provide permissions/access for malicious applications, allowing adversaries to  [Steal Application Access Token] These stolen access tokens allow the adversary to perform various actions on behalf of the user via API calls.

In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution] to gain execution. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques, such as posing as a trusted source.  There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially clicking past protections), the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system. The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses.

T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs. Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program.  Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.  There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads. Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files (DLLs) in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program. Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,  by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL. Often this location is the current working directory of the program. Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL.   Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled (in the Registry and creation of a redirection file) may cause a program to load a different DLL.  If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level. In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program. Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.","['[RTM] has used search order hijacking to force TeamViewer to load a malicious DLL.', '[Tonto Team] abuses a legitimate and signed Microsoft executable to launch a malicious DLL.', '[HTTPBrowser] abuses the Windows DLL load order by using a legitimate Symantec anti-virus binary, VPDN_LU.exe, to load a malicious DLL that mimics a legitimate Symantec DLL, navlu.dll.', 'Variants of [WEBC2] achieve persistence by using DLL search order hijacking, usually by copying the DLL file to <code>%SYSTEMROOT%</code> (<code>C:\\WINDOWS\\ntshrui.dll</code>).', '[Hikit] has used [DLL Search Order Hijacking] to load <code>oci.dll</code> as a persistence mechanism.', '[Whitefly] has used search order hijacking to run the loader Vcrodat.\t', 'A [FinFisher] variant uses DLL search order hijacking.', '[Aquatic Panda] has used DLL search-order hijacking to load `exe`, `dll`, and `dat` files into memory.', '[RedLeaves] is launched through use of DLL search order hijacking to load a malicious dll.', '[PlugX] has the ability to use DLL search order hijacking for installation on targeted systems.', '[Ramsay] can hijack outdated Windows application dependencies with malicious versions of its own DLL payload.\t', '[Evilnum] has used the malware variant, TerraTV, to load a malicious DLL placed in the TeamViewer directory, instead of the original Windows DLL located in a system folder.

T1553.002,Code Signing,"Adversaries may create, acquire, or steal code signing materials to sign their malware or tools. Code signing provides a level of authenticity on a binary from the developer and a guarantee that the binary has not been tampered with.  The certificates used during an operation may be created, acquired, or stolen by the adversary.   Unlike [Invalid Code Signature] this activity will result in a valid signature.  Code signing to verify software on first run can be used on modern Windows and macOS systems. It is not used on Linux due to the decentralized nature of the platform.   Code signing certificates may be used to bypass security policies that require signed code to execute on a system.

T1565.003,Runtime Data Manipulation,"Adversaries may modify systems in order to manipulate the data as it is accessed and displayed to an end user, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating runtime data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.  Adversaries may alter application binaries used to display data in order to cause runtime manipulations. Adversaries may also conduct [Change Default File Association] and [Masquerading] to cause a similar effect. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target application and process as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary. For complex systems, an adversary would likely need special expertise and possibly access to specialized software related to the system that would typically be gained through a prolonged information gathering campaign in order to have the desired impact.",['[APT38] has used DYEPACK.FOX to manipulate PDF data as it is accessed to remove traces of fraudulent SWIFT transactions from the data displayed to the end user.']
T1499.002,Service Exhaustion Flood,"Adversaries may target the different network services provided by systems to conduct a denial of service (DoS). Adversaries often target the availability of DNS and web services, however others have been targeted as well. Web server software can be attacked through a variety of means, some of which apply generally while others are specific to the software being used to provide the service.  One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it. This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service.  Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS. The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections. If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm. In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests. Because the cryptographic renegotiation has a meaningful cost in computation cycles, this can cause an impact to the availability of the service when done in volume.",[]
T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs. Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program.  Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path. Unlike [DLL Search Order Hijacking] the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program.    However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory. An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking (i.e., a program that does not specify the path to an executable) may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory.  For example, ""example.exe"" runs ""cmd.exe"" with the command-line argument <code>net user</code>. An adversary may place a program called ""net.exe"" within the same directory as example.exe, ""net.exe"" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net. In addition, if an adversary places a program called ""net.com"" in the same directory as ""net.exe"", then <code>cmd.exe /C net user</code> will execute ""net.com"" instead of ""net.exe"" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT.   Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in [DLL Search Order Hijacking]","['[Empire] contains modules that can discover and exploit search order hijacking vulnerabilities.', '[PowerSploit] contains a collection of Privesc-PowerUp modules that can discover and exploit search order hijacking vulnerabilities.']"
T1505.003,Web Shell,"Adversaries may backdoor web servers with web shells to establish persistent access to systems. A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network. A Web shell may provide a set of functions to execute or a command-line interface on the system that hosts the Web server.  In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web server (e.g. [China Chopper] Web shell client).","['[P.A.S.

T1552.004,Private Keys,"Adversaries may search for private key certificate files on compromised systems for insecurely stored credentials. Private cryptographic keys and certificates are used for authentication, encryption/decryption, and digital signatures. Common key and certificate file extensions include: .key, .pgp, .gpg, .ppk., .p12, .pem, .pfx, .cer, .p7b, .asc.   Adversaries may also look in common key directories, such as <code>~/.ssh</code> for SSH keys on * nix-based systems or <code>C:&#92;Users&#92;(username)&#92;.ssh&#92;</code> on Windows. Adversary tools may also search compromised systems for file extensions relating to cryptographic keys and certificates.  When a device is registered to Azure AD, a device key and a transport key are generated and used to verify the device’s identity. An adversary with access to the device may be able to export the keys in order to impersonate the device.  On network devices, private keys may be exported via [Network Device CLI] commands such as `crypto pki export`.   Some private keys require a password or passphrase for operation, so an adversary may also use [Input Capture] for keylogging or attempt to [Brute Force] the passphrase off-line. These private keys can be used to authenticate to [Remote Services] like SSH or for use in decrypting other collected files such as email.","['[Machete] has scanned and looked for cryptographic keys and certificate file extensions.

T1078.001,Default Accounts,"Adversaries may obtain and abuse credentials of a default account as a means of gaining Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, or Defense Evasion. Default accounts are those that are built-into an OS, such as the Guest or Administrator accounts on Windows systems. Default accounts also include default factory/provider set accounts on other types of systems, software, or devices, including the root user account in AWS and the default service account in Kubernetes.  Default accounts are not limited to client machines, rather also include accounts that are preset for equipment such as network devices and computer applications whether they are internal, open source, or commercial. Appliances that come preset with a username and password combination pose a serious threat to organizations that do not change it post installation, as they are easy targets for an adversary. Similarly, adversaries may also utilize publicly disclosed or stolen [Private Keys] or credential materials to legitimately connect to remote environments via [Remote Services]","['[FIN13] has leveraged default credentials for authenticating myWebMethods (WMS) and QLogic web management interface to gain initial access.', '[HyperStack] can use default credentials to connect to IPC$ shares on remote machines.', '[Magic Hound] enabled and used the default system managed account, DefaultAccount, via `""powershell.exe"" /c net user DefaultAccount /active:yes` to connect to a targeted Exchange server over RDP.', '[Stuxnet] infected WinCC machines via a hardcoded database server password.']"
T1558.001,Golden Ticket,"Adversaries who have the KRBTGT account password hash may forge Kerberos ticket-granting tickets (TGT), also known as a golden ticket. Golden tickets enable adversaries to generate authentication material for any account in Active Directory.   Using a golden ticket, adversaries are then able to request ticket granting service (TGS) tickets, which enable access to specific resources. Golden tickets require adversaries to interact with the Key Distribution Center (KDC) in order to obtain TGS.  The KDC service runs all on domain controllers that are part of an Active Directory domain. KRBTGT is the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC) service account and is responsible for encrypting and signing all Kerberos tickets. The KRBTGT password hash may be obtained using [OS Credential Dumping] and privileged access to a domain controller.","['[Ke3chang] has used [Mimikatz] to generate Kerberos golden tickets.', '[Empire] can leverage its implementation of [Mimikatz] to obtain and use golden tickets.', '[Mimikatz] kerberos module can create golden tickets.', '[Rubeus] can forge a ticket-granting ticket.']"
T1552.001,Credentials In Files,"Adversaries may search local file systems and remote file shares for files containing insecurely stored credentials. These can be files created by users to store their own credentials, shared credential stores for a group of individuals, configuration files containing passwords for a system or service, or source code/binary files containing embedded passwords.  It is possible to extract passwords from backups or saved virtual machines through [OS Credential Dumping]  Passwords may also be obtained from Group Policy Preferences stored on the Windows Domain Controller.   In cloud and/or containerized environments, authenticated user and service account credentials are often stored in local configuration and credential files.

T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,"Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls. For example, an adversary can duplicate an existing token using `DuplicateToken` or `DuplicateTokenEx`. The token can then be used with `ImpersonateLoggedOnUser` to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with `SetThreadToken` to assign the impersonated token to a thread.  An adversary may perform [Token Impersonation/Theft] when they have a specific, existing process they want to assign the duplicated token to. For example, this may be useful for when the target user has a non-network logon session on the system.  When an adversary would instead use a duplicated token to create a new process rather than attaching to an existing process, they can additionally [Create Process with Token] using `CreateProcessWithTokenW` or `CreateProcessAsUserW`.

T1059.001,PowerShell,"Adversaries may abuse PowerShell commands and scripts for execution. PowerShell is a powerful interactive command-line interface and scripting environment included in the Windows operating system. Adversaries can use PowerShell to perform a number of actions, including discovery of information and execution of code. Examples include the <code>Start-Process</code> cmdlet which can be used to run an executable and the <code>Invoke-Command</code> cmdlet which runs a command locally or on a remote computer (though administrator permissions are required to use PowerShell to connect to remote systems).  PowerShell may also be used to download and run executables from the Internet, which can be executed from disk or in memory without touching disk.

T1542.004,ROMMONkit,"Adversaries may abuse the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) by loading an unauthorized firmware with adversary code to provide persistent access and manipulate device behavior that is difficult to detect.    ROMMON is a Cisco network device firmware that functions as a boot loader, boot image, or boot helper to initialize hardware and software when the platform is powered on or reset. Similar to [TFTP Boot] an adversary may upgrade the ROMMON image locally or remotely (for example, through TFTP) with adversary code and restart the device in order to overwrite the existing ROMMON image. This provides adversaries with the means to update the ROMMON to gain persistence on a system in a way that may be difficult to detect.",[]

Unix shells are the primary command prompt on Linux and macOS systems, though many variations of the Unix shell exist (e.g. sh, bash, zsh, etc.) depending on the specific OS or distribution. Unix shells can control every aspect of a system, with certain commands requiring elevated privileges.  Unix shells also support scripts that enable sequential execution of commands as well as other typical programming operations such as conditionals and loops. Common uses of shell scripts include long or repetitive tasks, or the need to run the same set of commands on multiple systems.  Adversaries may abuse Unix shells to execute various commands or payloads.

T1518.001,Security Software Discovery,"Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on a system or in a cloud environment. This may include things such as firewall rules and anti-virus. Adversaries may use the information from [Security Software Discovery] during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.  Example commands that can be used to obtain security software information are [netsh] <code>reg query</code> with [Reg] <code>dir</code> with [cmd] and [Tasklist] but other indicators of discovery behavior may be more specific to the type of software or security system the adversary is looking for. It is becoming more common to see macOS malware perform checks for LittleSnitch and KnockKnock software.

T1565.002,Transmitted Data Manipulation,"Adversaries may alter data en route to storage or other systems in order to manipulate external outcomes or hide activity, thus threatening the integrity of the data. By manipulating transmitted data, adversaries may attempt to affect a business process, organizational understanding, and decision making.  Manipulation may be possible over a network connection or between system processes where there is an opportunity deploy a tool that will intercept and change information. The type of modification and the impact it will have depends on the target transmission mechanism as well as the goals and objectives of the adversary.

By default, <code>/etc/shadow</code> is only readable by the root user.

T1550.002,Pass the Hash,"Adversaries may “pass the hash” using stolen password hashes to move laterally within an environment, bypassing normal system access controls. Pass the hash (PtH) is a method of authenticating as a user without having access to the user's cleartext password. This method bypasses standard authentication steps that require a cleartext password, moving directly into the portion of the authentication that uses the password hash.  When performing PtH, valid password hashes for the account being used are captured using a [Credential Access] technique. Captured hashes are used with PtH to authenticate as that user. Once authenticated, PtH may be used to perform actions on local or remote systems.  Adversaries may also use stolen password hashes to ""overpass the hash."" Similar to PtH, this involves using a password hash to authenticate as a user but also uses the password hash to create a valid Kerberos ticket. This ticket can then be used to perform [Pass the Ticket] attacks.","['[APT32] has used pass the hash for lateral movement.', '[Cobalt Strike] can perform pass the hash.', '[Pass-The-Hash Toolkit] can perform pass the hash.', '[APT28] has used pass the hash for lateral movement.', '[Chimera] has dumped password hashes for use in pass the hash authentication attacks.', 'The [APT1] group is known to have used pass the hash.', '[Wizard Spider] has used the `Invoke-SMBExec` PowerShell cmdlet to execute the pass-the-hash technique and utilized stolen password hashes to move laterally.', '[HOPLIGHT] has been observed loading several APIs associated with Pass the Hash.\t', '[PoshC2] has a number of modules that leverage pass the hash for lateral movement.', '[Mimikatz] <code>SEKURLSA::Pth</code> module can impersonate a user, with only a password hash, to execute arbitrary commands.', '[Kimsuky] has used pass the hash for authentication to remote access software used in C2.', '[Empire] can perform pass the hash attacks.', '[FIN13] has used the PowerShell utility `Invoke-SMBExec` to execute the pass the hash method for lateral movement within an compromised environment.', '[BADHATCH] can perform pass the hash on compromised machines with x64 versions.

T1574.002,DLL Side-Loading,"Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by side-loading DLLs. Similar to [DLL Search Order Hijacking] side-loading involves hijacking which DLL a program loads. But rather than just planting the DLL within the search order of a program then waiting for the victim application to be invoked, adversaries may directly side-load their payloads by planting then invoking a legitimate application that executes their payload(s).  Side-loading takes advantage of the DLL search order used by the loader by positioning both the victim application and malicious payload(s) alongside each other. Adversaries likely use side-loading as a means of masking actions they perform under a legitimate, trusted, and potentially elevated system or software process. Benign executables used to side-load payloads may not be flagged during delivery and/or execution. Adversary payloads may also be encrypted/packed or otherwise obfuscated until loaded into the memory of the trusted process.","['[Chimera] has used side loading to place malicious DLLs in memory.', '[Chinoxy] can use a digitally signed binary (""Logitech Bluetooth Wizard Host Process"") to load its dll into memory.', '[MuddyWater] maintains persistence on victim networks through side-loading dlls to trick legitimate programs into running malware.', '[Brute Ratel C4] has loaded a malicious DLL by spoofing the name of the legitimate Version.DLL  and placing it in the same folder as the digitally-signed Microsoft binary OneDriveUpdater.exe.', '[Dridex] can abuse legitimate Windows executables to side-load malicious DLL files.', '[Pandora] can use DLL side-loading to execute malicious payloads.', 'A [Patchwork] .dll that contains [BADNEWS] is loaded and executed using DLL side-loading.', '[Wingbird] side loads a malicious file, sspisrv.dll, in part of a spoofed lssas.exe service.', '[Javali] can use DLL side-loading to load malicious DLLs into legitimate executables.', '[BADNEWS] typically loads its DLL file into a legitimate signed Java or VMware executable.', '[Threat Group-3390] has used DLL side-loading, including by using legitimate Kaspersky antivirus variants as well as `rc.exe`, a legitimate Microsoft Resource Compiler.', '[HyperBro] has used a legitimate application to sideload a DLL to decrypt, decompress, and run a payload.', '[GALLIUM] used DLL side-loading to covertly load [PoisonIvy] into memory on the victim machine.', '[Higaisa] JavaScript file used a legitimate Microsoft Office 2007 package to side-load the <code>OINFO12.OCX</code> dynamic link library.', '[Metamorfo] has side-loaded its malicious DLL file.

T1550.001,Application Access Token,"Adversaries may use stolen application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems. These tokens are typically stolen from users or services and used in lieu of login credentials.  Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used to access resources in cloud, container-based applications, and software-as-a-service (SaaS).   OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems. These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform. Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user. Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application.  For example, with a cloud-based email service, once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a ""refresh"" token enabling background access is awarded. With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.  Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services. For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines. In AWS and GCP environments, adversaries can trigger a request for a short-lived access token with the privileges of another user account. The adversary can then use this token to request data or perform actions the original account could not. If permissions for this feature are misconfigured – for example, by allowing all users to request a token for a particular account - an adversary may be able to gain initial access to a Cloud Account or escalate their privileges.  Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.  For example, in AWS environments, an adversary who compromises a user’s AWS API credentials may be able to use the `sts:GetFederationToken` API call to create a federated user session, which will have the same permissions as the original user but may persist even if the original user credentials are deactivated. Additionally, access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow.","['[Peirates] can use stolen service account tokens to perform its operations. It also enables adversaries to switch between valid service accounts.', '[CreepyDrive] can use legitimate OAuth refresh tokens to authenticate with OneDrive.', 'During the [SolarWinds Compromise] [APT29] used compromised service principals to make changes to the Office 365 environment.', '[APT28] has used several malicious applications that abused OAuth access tokens to gain access to target email accounts, including Gmail and Yahoo Mail.', '[APT29] has used compromised service principals to make changes to the Office 365 environment.']"
T1055.001,Dynamic-link Library Injection,"Adversaries may inject dynamic-link libraries (DLLs) into processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges. DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.    DLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread. The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as <code>VirtualAllocEx</code> and <code>WriteProcessMemory</code>, then invoked with <code>CreateRemoteThread</code> (which calls the <code>LoadLibrary</code> API responsible for loading the DLL).    Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection (writing a self-mapping DLL into a process) and memory module (map DLL when writing into process) overcome the address relocation issue as well as the additional APIs to invoke execution (since these methods load and execute the files in memory by manually preforming the function of <code>LoadLibrary</code>).   Another variation of this method, often referred to as Module Stomping/Overloading or DLL Hollowing, may be leveraged to conceal injected code within a process. This method involves loading a legitimate DLL into a remote process then manually overwriting the module's <code>AddressOfEntryPoint</code> before starting a new thread in the target process. This variation allows attackers to hide malicious injected code by potentially backing its execution with a legitimate DLL file on disk.   Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges. Execution via DLL injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

T1404,Exploitation for Privilege Escalation,"Adversaries may exploit software vulnerabilities in order to elevate privileges. Exploitation of a software vulnerability occurs when an adversary takes advantage of a programming error in an application, service, within the operating system software, or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Security constructions, such as permission levels, will often hinder access to information and use of certain techniques. Adversaries will likely need to perform privilege escalation to include use of software exploitation to circumvent those restrictions.   When initially gaining access to a device, an adversary may be operating within a lower privileged process which will prevent them from accessing certain resources on the system. Vulnerabilities may exist, usually in operating system components and applications running at higher permissions, that can be exploited to gain higher levels of access on the system. This could enable someone to move from unprivileged or user- level permission to root permissions depending on the component that is vulnerable.

T1575,Native API,"Adversaries may use Android’s Native Development Kit (NDK) to write native functions that can achieve execution of binaries or functions. Like system calls on a traditional desktop operating system, native code achieves execution on a lower level than normal Android SDK calls.  The NDK allows developers to write native code in C or C++ that is compiled directly to machine code, avoiding all intermediate languages and steps in compilation that higher level languages, like Java, typically have. The Java Native Interface (JNI) is the component that allows Java functions in the Android app to call functions in a native library.  Adversaries may also choose to use native functions to execute malicious code since native actions are typically much more difficult to analyze than standard, non-native behaviors.","['[TERRACOTTA] has included native modules.', '[HenBox] has contained native libraries.', '[Asacub] has implemented functions in native code.', '[CarbonSteal] has seen native libraries used in some reported samples ', '[CHEMISTGAMES] has utilized native code to decrypt its malicious payload.', '[Bread] has used native code in an attempt to disguise malicious functionality.']"

T1478,Install Insecure or Malicious Configuration,"An adversary could attempt to install insecure or malicious configuration settings on the mobile device, through means such as phishing emails or text messages either directly containing the configuration settings as an attachment, or containing a web link to the configuration settings. The device user may be tricked into installing the configuration settings through social engineering techniques .  For example, an unwanted Certification Authority (CA) certificate could be placed in the device's trusted certificate store, increasing the device's susceptibility to adversary-in-the-middle network attacks seeking to eavesdrop on or manipulate the device's network communication ([Eavesdrop on Insecure Network Communication] and [Manipulate Device Communication]  On iOS, malicious Configuration Profiles could contain unwanted Certification Authority (CA) certificates or other insecure settings such as unwanted proxy server or VPN settings to route the device's network traffic through an adversary's system. The device could also potentially be enrolled into a malicious Mobile Device Management (MDM) system .",[]
T1461,Lockscreen Bypass,"An adversary with physical access to a mobile device may seek to bypass the device’s lockscreen. Several methods exist to accomplish this, including:  * Biometric spoofing: If biometric authentication is used, an adversary could attempt to spoof a mobile device’s biometric authentication mechanism. Both iOS and Android partly mitigate this attack by requiring the device’s passcode rather than biometrics to unlock the device after every device restart, and after a set or random amount of time. * Unlock code bypass: An adversary could attempt to brute-force or otherwise guess the lockscreen passcode (typically a PIN or password), including physically observing (“shoulder surfing”) the device owner’s use of the lockscreen passcode. Mobile OS vendors partly mitigate this by implementing incremental backoff timers after a set number of failed unlock attempts, as well as a configurable full device wipe after several failed unlock attempts. * Vulnerability exploit: Techniques have been periodically demonstrated that exploit mobile devices to bypass the lockscreen. The vulnerabilities are generally patched by the device or OS vendor once disclosed. ",['[Escobar] can request the `DISABLE_KEYGUARD` permission to disable the device lock screen password.']
T1533,Data from Local System,"Adversaries may search local system sources, such as file systems or local databases, to find files of interest and sensitive data prior to exfiltration.       Access to local system data, which includes information stored by the operating system, often requires escalated privileges.

T1456,Drive-By Compromise,"Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing. With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring an [Application Access Token]  Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist, including:  * A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting. * Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers. * Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client (e.g. forum posts, comments, and other user controllable web content).  Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest. This kind of targeted attack is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack. There are several known examples of this occurring.  Typical drive-by compromise process:  1. A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content. 2. Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version.      * The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes. 3. Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser. 4. If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place.     * In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.","['[Pegasus for iOS] was distributed through a web site by exploiting vulnerabilities in the Safari web browser on iOS devices.', '[YiSpecter] is believed to have initially infected devices using internet traffic hijacking to generate abnormal popups.

T0803,Block Command Message,"Adversaries may block a command message from reaching its intended target to prevent command execution. In OT networks, command messages are sent to provide instructions to control system devices. A blocked command message can inhibit response functions from correcting a disruption or unsafe condition.

T0836,Modify Parameter,"Adversaries may modify parameters used to instruct industrial control system devices. These devices operate via programs that dictate how and when to perform actions based on such parameters. Such parameters can determine the extent to which an action is performed and may specify additional options. For example, a program on a control system device dictating motor processes may take a parameter defining the total number of seconds to run that motor.        An adversary can potentially modify these parameters to produce an outcome outside of what was intended by the operators. By modifying system and process critical parameters, the adversary may cause [Impact] to equipment and/or control processes. Modified parameters may be turned into dangerous, out-of-bounds, or unexpected values from typical operations. For example, specifying that a process run for more or less time than it should, or dictating an unusually high, low, or invalid value as a parameter.","['[INCONTROLLER] can use the HTTP CGI scripts on Omron PLCs to modify parameters on EtherCat connected servo drives.

T0814,Denial of Service,"Adversaries may perform Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks to disrupt expected device functionality. Examples of DoS attacks include overwhelming the target device with a high volume of requests in a short time period and sending the target device a request it does not know how to handle. Disrupting device state may temporarily render it unresponsive, possibly lasting until a reboot can occur. When placed in this state, devices may be unable to send and receive requests, and may not perform expected response functions in reaction to other events in the environment.   Some ICS devices are particularly sensitive to DoS events, and may become unresponsive in reaction to even a simple ping sweep. Adversaries may also attempt to execute a Permanent Denial-of-Service (PDoS) against certain devices, such as in the case of the BrickerBot malware.    Adversaries may exploit a software vulnerability to cause a denial of service by taking advantage of a programming error in a program, service, or within the operating system software or kernel itself to execute adversary-controlled code. Vulnerabilities may exist in software that can be used to cause a denial of service condition.   Adversaries may have prior knowledge about industrial protocols or control devices used in the environment through [Remote System Information Discovery] There are examples of adversaries remotely causing a [Device Restart/Shutdown] by exploiting a vulnerability that induces uncontrolled resource consumption.

', 'The [Backdoor.Oldrea] payload has caused multiple common OPC platforms to intermittently crash. This could cause a denial of service effect on applications reliant on OPC communications. ']"
T0816,Device Restart/Shutdown,"Adversaries may forcibly restart or shutdown a device in an ICS environment to disrupt and potentially negatively impact physical processes. Methods of device restart and shutdown exist in some devices as built-in, standard functionalities. These functionalities can be executed using interactive device web interfaces, CLIs, and network protocol commands.  Unexpected restart or shutdown of control system devices may prevent expected response functions happening during critical states.  A device restart can also be a sign of malicious device modifications, as many updates require a shutdown in order to take effect.","['The [Industroyer] SIPROTEC DoS module exploits the CVE-2015-5374 vulnerability in order to render a Siemens SIPROTEC device unresponsive. While the vulnerability does not directly cause the restart or shutdown of the device, the device must be restarted manually before it can resume operations.

']"
T0860,Wireless Compromise,"Adversaries may perform wireless compromise as a method of gaining communications and unauthorized access to a wireless network. Access to a wireless network may be gained through the compromise of a wireless device.   Adversaries may also utilize radios and other wireless communication devices on the same frequency as the wireless network. Wireless compromise can be done as an initial access vector from a remote distance.   A Polish student used a modified TV remote controller to gain access to and control over the Lodz city tram system in Poland.   The remote controller device allowed the student to interface with the trams network to modify track settings and override operator control. The adversary may have accomplished this by aligning the controller to the frequency and amplitude of IR control protocol signals.  The controller then enabled initial access to the network, allowing the capture and replay of tram signals. ","[""In the [Maroochy Water Breach] the adversary used a two-way radio to communicate with and set the frequencies of Maroochy Shire's repeater stations.""]"
T0842,Network Sniffing,"Network sniffing is the practice of using a network interface on a computer system to monitor or capture information  regardless of whether it is the specified destination for the information.   An adversary may attempt to sniff the traffic to gain information about the target. This information can vary in the level of importance. Relatively unimportant information is general communications to and from machines.  Relatively important information would be login information. User credentials may be sent over an unencrypted protocol, such as Telnet, that can be captured and obtained through network packet analysis.   In addition, ARP and Domain Name Service (DNS) poisoning can be used to capture credentials to websites, proxies, and internal systems by redirecting traffic to an adversary.","['The [VPNFilter] packet sniffer looks for basic authentication as well as monitors ICS traffic, and is specific to the TP-LINK R600-VPN. The malware uses a raw socket to look for connections to a pre-specified IP address, only looking at TCP packets that are 150 bytes or larger. Packets that are not on port 502, are scanned for BasicAuth, and that information is logged. This may have allowed credential harvesting from communications between devices accessing a modbus-enabled HMI.  ', '[INCONTROLLER] can deploy Tcpdump to sniff network traffic and collect PCAP files.

The original block is copied to FC1869, and then replaced by a malicious block. Each time the function is used to receive a packet, the malicious [Stuxnet] block takes control: it will call the original DP_RECV in FC1869 and then perform postprocessing on the packet data. The replaced DP_RECV block (later on referred to as the DP_RECV monitor) is meant to monitor data sent by the frequency converter drives to the 315-2 CPU via CP 342-5 Profibus communication modules. ']"
T0804,Block Reporting Message,"Adversaries may block or prevent a reporting message from reaching its intended target. In control systems, reporting messages contain telemetry data (e.g., I/O values) pertaining to the current state of equipment and the industrial process. By blocking these reporting messages, an adversary can potentially hide their actions from an operator.  Blocking reporting messages in control systems that manage physical processes may contribute to system impact, causing inhibition of a response function. A control system may not be able to respond in a proper or timely manner to an event, such as a dangerous fault, if its corresponding reporting message is blocked.   ","['[Industroyer] uses the first COM port from the configuration file for the communication and the other two COM ports are opened to prevent other processes accessing them.

T0855,Unauthorized Command Message,"Adversaries may send unauthorized command messages to instruct control system assets to perform actions outside of their intended functionality, or without the logical preconditions to trigger their expected function. Command messages are used in ICS networks to give direct instructions to control systems devices. If an adversary can send an unauthorized command message to a control system, then it can instruct the control systems device to perform an action outside the normal bounds of the device's actions. An adversary could potentially instruct a control systems device to perform an action that will cause an [Impact]   In the Dallas Siren incident, adversaries were able to send command messages to activate tornado alarm systems across the city without an impending tornado or other disaster.

', 'Using [Triton] an adversary can manipulate the process into an unsafe state from the DCS while preventing the SIS from functioning appropriately.']"
T0880,Loss of Safety,Adversaries may compromise safety system functions designed to maintain safe operation of a process when unacceptable or dangerous conditions occur. Safety systems are often composed of the same elements as control systems but have the sole purpose of ensuring the process fails in a predetermined safe manner.   Many unsafe conditions in process control happen too quickly for a human operator to react to. Speed is critical in correcting these conditions to limit serious impacts such as Loss of Control and Property Damage.   Adversaries may target and disable safety system functions as a prerequisite to subsequent attack execution or to allow for future unsafe conditionals to go unchecked. Detection of a Loss of Safety by operators can result in the shutdown of a process due to strict policies regarding safety systems. This can cause a Loss of Productivity and Revenue and may meet the technical goals of adversaries seeking to cause process disruptions.,"['[Triton] has the capability to reprogram the SIS logic to allow unsafe conditions to persist or reprogram the SIS to allow an unsafe state  while using the DCS to create an unsafe state or hazard.

T0828,Loss of Productivity and Revenue,"Adversaries may cause loss of productivity and revenue through disruption and even damage to the availability and integrity of control system operations, devices, and related processes. This technique may manifest as a direct effect of an ICS-targeting attack or tangentially, due to an IT-targeting attack against non-segregated environments.   In cases where these operations or services are brought to a halt, the loss of productivity may eventually present an impact for the end-users or consumers of products and services. The disrupted supply-chain may result in supply shortages and increased prices, among other consequences.   A ransomware attack on an Australian beverage company resulted in the shutdown of some manufacturing sites, including precautionary halts to protect key systems.  The company announced the potential for temporary shortages of their products following the attack.     In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, the pipeline was unable to transport approximately 2.5 million barrels of fuel per day to the East Coast.

T0812,Default Credentials,"Adversaries may leverage manufacturer or supplier set default credentials on control system devices. These default credentials may have administrative permissions and may be necessary for initial configuration of the device. It is general best practice to change the passwords for these accounts as soon as possible, but some manufacturers may have devices that have passwords or usernames that cannot be changed.   Default credentials are normally documented in an instruction manual that is either packaged with the device, published online through official means, or published online through unofficial means. Adversaries may leverage default credentials that have not been properly modified or disabled.",[]
T0875,Change Program State,Adversaries may attempt to change the state of the current program on a control device. Program state changes may be used to allow for another program to take over control or be loaded onto the device.,"['After [PLC-Blaster] is transferred to a PLC, the PLC begins execution of PLC-Blaster.', '[Triton] has the ability to halt or run a program through the TriStation protocol.

T0826,Loss of Availability,"Adversaries may attempt to disrupt essential components or systems to prevent owner and operator from delivering products or services.      Adversaries may leverage malware to delete or encrypt critical data on HMIs, workstations, or databases.  In the 2021 Colonial Pipeline ransomware incident, pipeline operations were temporally halted on May 7th and were not fully restarted until May 12th. ","['A [Conficker] infection at a nuclear power plant forced the facility to temporarily shutdown. ', 'During the [2015 Ukraine Electric Power Attack] [Sandworm Team] opened the breakers at the infected sites, shutting the power off for thousands of businesses and households for around 6 hours. ']"
T0859,Valid Accounts,"Adversaries may steal the credentials of a specific user or service account using credential access techniques. In some cases, default credentials for control system devices may be publicly available. Compromised credentials may be used to bypass access controls placed on various resources on hosts and within the network, and may even be used for persistent access to remote systems. Compromised and default credentials may also grant an adversary increased privilege to specific systems and devices or access to restricted areas of the network. Adversaries may choose not to use malware or tools, in conjunction with the legitimate access those credentials provide, to make it harder to detect their presence or to control devices and send legitimate commands in an unintended way.   Adversaries may also create accounts, sometimes using predefined account names and passwords, to provide a means of backup access for persistence.    The overlap of credentials and permissions across a network of systems is of concern because the adversary may be able to pivot across accounts and systems to reach a high level of access (i.e., domain or enterprise administrator)  and possibly between the enterprise and operational technology environments. Adversaries may be able to leverage valid credentials from one system to gain access to another system.","['[ALLANITE] utilized credentials collected through phishing and watering hole attacks.

', '[Dragonfly] leveraged compromised user credentials to access the targets networks and download tools from a remote server.']"
T0833,Modify Control Logic,"Adversaries may place malicious code in a system, which can cause the system to malfunction by modifying its control logic. Control system devices use programming languages (e.g. relay ladder logic) to control physical processes by affecting actuators, which cause machines to operate, based on environment sensor readings. These devices often include the ability to perform remote control logic updates.   Program code is normally edited in a vendor-specific Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that relies on proprietary tools and features. These IDEs allow an engineer to perform host target development and may have the ability to run the code on the machine it is programmed for. The IDE will transmit the control logic to the testing device, and will perform the required device-specific functions to apply the changes and make them active.  An adversary may attempt to use this host target IDE to modify device control logic. Even though proprietary tools are often used to edit and update control logic, the process can usually be reverse-engineered and reproduced with open-source tools.  An adversary can de-calibrate a sensor by removing functions in control logic that account for sensor error. This can be used to change a control process without actually spoofing command messages to a controller or device.   It is believed this process happened in the lesser known over-pressurizer attacks build into Stuxnet. Pressure sensors are not perfect at translating pressure into an analog output signal, but their errors can be corrected by calibration. The pressure controller can be told what the “real” pressure is for given analog signals and then automatically linearize the measurement to what would be the “real” pressure. If the linearization is overwritten by malicious code on the S7-417 controller, analog pressure readings will be “corrected” during the attack by the pressure controller, which then interprets all analog pressure readings as perfectly normal pressure no matter how high or low their analog values are. The pressure controller then acts accordingly by never opening the stage exhaust valves. In the meantime, actual pressure keeps rising.   In the Maroochy Attack, Vitek Boden gained remote computer access to the control system and altered data so that whatever function should have occurred at affected pumping stations did not occur or occurred in a different way. The software program installed in the laptop was one developed by Hunter Watertech for its use in changing configurations in the PDS computers. This ultimately led to 800,000 liters of raw sewage being spilled out into the community. ","['[Triton] can reprogram the SIS logic to cause it to trip and shutdown a process that is, in actuality, in a safe state. In other words, trigger a false positive. Triton also can reprogram the SIS logic to allow unsafe conditions to persist.The Triton malware is able to add a malicious program to the execution table of the controller.

T0873,Project File Infection,"Adversaries may attempt to infect project files with malicious code. These project files may consist of objects, program organization units, variables such as tags, documentation, and other configurations needed for PLC programs to function.  Using built in functions of the engineering software, adversaries may be able to download an infected program to a PLC in the operating environment enabling further [Execution] and [Persistence] techniques.    Adversaries may export their own code into project files with conditions to execute at specific intervals.  Malicious programs allow adversaries control of all aspects of the process enabled by the PLC. Once the project file is downloaded to a PLC the workstation device may be disconnected with the infected project file still executing.
