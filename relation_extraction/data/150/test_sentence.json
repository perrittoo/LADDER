Aside from the inescapable irony of disguising a security-reducing Trojan as an ostensibly security-enhancing app, and the righteous affront to the whole concept of a VPN\u2019s purpose a Trojan so disguised inspires, this represents an escalation in the variety of app types targeted by this campaign of bankbots in disguise. In the wild, we found Web pages designed to (vaguely) resemble legitimate app market pages, hosting files for download that have been disguised as a legitimate mobile application of moderately broad appeal, such as a media player or social media app. But the categories targeted by this group seem to be broadening with the inclusion of VPN software. The Web page shown here on the left is hosted on a domain that seems apt: free-vpn[.]download. Investigation of this domain led to additional domains that appear to have been registered for use with the campaign, but are not in use yet. (You can find additional IoCs at the end of this article) As you can see, the Web page uses a similar colour scheme as, and the icon design from, a legitimate VPN application (VPN Proxy Master) found on the <e2>Google Play store</e2>.

The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately.

A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake \u201cAdobe Flash Player\u201d apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan.

If the malware obtains device administrator rights, it will be able to lock the screen by itself, expire the password, and resist being uninstalled through normal methods. The app then stays in the background listening to commands from the cybercrooks. Within some of the first of those commands, the bot typically receives a list of banks it will target. The Trojan works by creating an overlay whenever the user launches the banking application. Currently Running Applications Banking Trojans that rely on the overlay mechanism to steal information need to know what application is in the foreground. They do this not only to identify whether the use of a particular app may permit them to harvest another credential, but also because each targeted app needs to have an overlay mapped to its design, so the Trojan can intercept and steal user data.

A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake \u201cAdobe Flash Player\u201d apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan.

Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, <e2>Instagram</e2>, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too.", "Once downloaded, the malicious apps then infect the user with the Exodus malware. \u201c<e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities,\u201d said researchers. \u201cWorryingly, some of the modifications enforced by the spyware might expose the infected devices to further compromise or data tampering.\u201d Installation Once the malicious apps are installed, a dropper is first deployed to collect some basic identifying information about the device, including itsmalicious app google play International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) code and phone number, and send it to the command-and-control (C2) server (the dropper in some cases purports to be a device check for the fake app).

Also, last month an Android spyware dubbed MobSTSPY emerged to ride trojanized apps into victims\u2019 phones, mainly via Google Play.

When they detailed the threat in September last year, SfyLabs\u2019 researchers said the malware included around 60 60 HTML overlays used to steal login credentials, but also revealed that the Trojan\u2019s actor was constantly releasing updates for their malicious program. A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in Australia, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, <e2>New Zeeland</e2>, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States.", "At that time, <e1>Ginp</e1> was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake \u201cAdobe Flash Player\u201d apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan. The 24 target apps belong to 7 different <e2>Spanish banks</e2>: Caixa bank, Bankinter, Bankia, BBVA, EVO Banco, Kutxabank and Santander.", "Users need to be aware of the existence of malware like <e1>Skygofree</e1>, and what to watch out for, namely that a legitimate website won\u2019t offer a download that speeds up your device, especially not one that you have to manually navigate to and install yourself.

A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake \u201cAdobe Flash Player\u201d apps. The malware was able to perform overlay attacks and become the default SMS app through the abuse of the Accessibility Service. The overlay consisted of a generic credit card grabber targeting social and utility apps, such as Google Play, Facebook, WhatsApp, Chrome, Skype, Instagram and Twitter. Although early versions had some basic code and string obfuscation, protection of the third version of the malware was enhanced with the use of payload obfuscation. The capabilities remained unchanged, but a new endpoint was added to the Trojan C2 allowing it to handle the generic card grabber overlay and specific target overlays (banking apps) separately. In addition, the credit card grabber target list was expanded with Snapchat and Viber. In the third version spotted in the wild, the author introduced parts of the source code of the infamous Anubis Trojan (which was leaked earlier in 2019). This change came hand in hand with a new overlay target list, no longer targeting social apps, but focusing on banking instead. A remarkable fact is that all the targeted apps relate to Spanish banks, including targets never seen before in any other Android banking Trojan.

First of all, samples of the malware used Italian words (such as Mundizza, a dialectal word typical of the Calabria region in Italy, which translates to \u201cgarbage\u201d in English). Secondly, the C2 configured in several of the malicious apps has an IP address that serves a self-signed TLS certificate linked to servers developed by eSurv. \u201cMany of these servers are control panels for video surveillance systems developed by the Italian company eSurv\u2026 eSurv\u2019s logo is identical to the command and control server icon,\u201d researchers said. eSurv\u2019s webpage, LinkedIn page and Twitter page all appear to have been taken down.

Also, last month an Android spyware dubbed MobSTSPY emerged to ride trojanized apps into victims\u2019 phones, mainly via Google Play. Also, early last year, Google removed 22 malicious adware apps ranging from flashlights and call recorders to WiFi signal boosters, which together were downloaded at least 7.5 million times from the Google Play marketplace.

The Trojan works by creating an overlay whenever the user launches the banking application. Currently Running Applications Banking Trojans that rely on the overlay mechanism to steal information need to know what application is in the foreground. They do this not only to identify whether the use of a particular app may permit them to harvest another credential, but also because each targeted app needs to have an overlay mapped to its design, so the Trojan can intercept and steal user data.

The attacks use Domain Name System (DNS) cache poisoning/DNS spoofing, possibly through infringement techniques such as brute-force or dictionary attacks, to distribute and install malicious Android apps. Trend Micro detects these as ANDROIDOS_XLOADER.HRX. These malware pose as legitimate Facebook or Chrome applications. They are distributed from polluted DNS domains that send a notification to an unknowing victim\u2019s device. The malicious apps can steal personally identifiable and financial data and install additional apps. XLoader can also hijack the infected device (i.e., send SMSs) and sports self-protection/persistence mechanisms through device administrator privileges. Infection Chain As with our earlier reports in late March, the attack chain involves diverting internet traffic to attacker-specified domains by compromising and overwriting the router\u2019s DNS settings. A fake alert will notify and urge the user to access the malicious domain and download XLoader. Technical Analysis XLoader first loads the encrypted payload from Assets/db as test.dex to drop the necessary modules then requests for device administrator privileges. Once granted permission, it hides its icon from the launcher application list then starts a service that it keeps running in the background. The background service uses the reflection technique (a feature that allows the inspection and modification of Java-based programs\u2019 internal properties) to invoke the method com.Loader.start in the payload. Monitoring Broadcast Events XLoader registers many broadcast receivers in the payload dynamically (to monitor broadcast events sent between system and applications). Registering broadcast receivers enable XLoader to trigger its malicious routines. Here is a list of broadcast actions: android.provider.Telephony.SMS_RECEIVED android.net.conn.CONNECTIVITY_CHANGE android.intent.action.BATTERY_CHANGED android.intent.action.USER_PRESENT android.intent.action.PHONE_STATE android.net.wifi.SCAN_RESULTS android.intent.action.PACKAGE_ADDED android.intent.action.PACKAGE_REMOVED android.intent.action.SCREEN_OFF android.intent.action.SCREEN_ON android.media.RINGER_MODE_CHANGED android.sms.msg.action.SMS_SEND android.sms.msg.action.SMS_DELIVERED Creating a Web Server to Phish XLoader creates a provisional web server to receive the broadcast events. It can also create a simple HTTP server on the infected device to deceive victims. It shows a web phishing page whenever the affected device receives a broadcast event (i.e., if a new package is installed or if the device\u2019s screen is on) to steal personal data, such as those keyed in for banking apps. The phishing page is translated in Korean, Japanese, Chinese, and English, which are hardcoded in the payload. It will appear differently to users depending on the language set on the device. XLoader as Spyware and Banking Trojan XLoader can also collect information related to usage of apps installed in the device. Its data-stealing capabilities include collecting SMSs after receiving an SMS-related broadcast event and covertly recording phone calls. XLoader can also hijack accounts linked to financial or game-related apps installed on the affected device. XLoader can also start other attacker-specified packages. A possible attack scenario involves replacing legitimate apps with repackaged or malicious versions. By monitoring the package installation broadcast event, XLoader can start their packages. This enables it to launch malicious apps without the user\u2019s awareness and explicit consent. We reverse engineered XLoader and found that it appears to target South Korea-based banks and game development companies. XLoader also prevents victims from accessing the device\u2019s settings or using a known antivirus (AV) app in the country. XLoader can also load multiple malicious modules to receive and execute commands from its remote command-and-control (C&C) server, as shown below: Here\u2019s a list of the modules and their functions: sendSms \u2014 send SMS/MMS to a specified address setWifi \u2014 enable or disable Wi-Fi connection gcont \u2014 collect all the device\u2019s contacts lock \u2014 currently just an input lock status in the settings (pref) file, but may be used as a screenlocking ransomware bc \u2014 collect all contacts from the Android device and SIM card setForward \u2014 currently not implemented, but can be used to hijack the infected device getForward \u2014 currently not implemented, but can be used to hijack the infected device hasPkg \u2014 check the device whether a specified app is installed or not setRingerMode \u2014 set the device\u2019s ringer mode setRecEnable \u2014 set the device\u2019s ringer mode as silent reqState \u2014 get a detailed phone connection status, which includes activated network and Wi-Fi (with or without password) showHome \u2014 force the device\u2019s back to the home screen getnpki: get files/content from the folder named NPKI (contains certificates related to financial transactions) http \u2014 access a specified network using HttpURLConnection onRecordAction \u2014 simulate a number-dialed tone call \u2014 call a specified number get_apps \u2014 get all the apps installed on the device show_fs_float_window \u2014 show a full-screen window for phishing Of note is XLoader\u2019s abuse of the WebSocket protocol (supported in many browsers and web applications) via ws(WebSockets) or wss(WebSockets over SSL/TLS) to communicate with its C&C servers. The URLs \u2014 abused as part of XLoader\u2019s C&C \u2014 are hidden in three webpages, and the C&C server that XLoader connects to differ per region. The abuse of the WebSocket protocol provides XLoader with a persistent connection between clients and servers where data can be transported any time. XLoader abuses the MessagePack (a data interchange format) to package the stolen data and exfiltrate it via the WebSocket protocol for faster and more efficient transmission. Mitigations XLoader will not download malicious apps if the Android device uses a mobile data connection. Nevertheless, users should practice proper security hygiene to mitigate threats that may take advantage of a home or business router\u2019s security gaps. Employ stronger credentials, for instance, to make them less susceptible to unauthorized access. Regularly update and patch the router\u2019s software and firmware to prevent exploits, and enable its built-in firewall. For system administrators and information security professionals, configuring the router to be more resistant to attacks like DNS cache poisoning can help mitigate similar threats. Everyday users can do the same by checking the router\u2019s DNS settings if they\u2019ve been modified. Even threats like DNS cache poisoning employ social engineering, so users should also be more prudent against suspicious or unknown messages that have telltale signs of malware.

The operator set a starting price of $50,000 -- with the aim of generating up to $100,000 -- for the malware's .APK source code, client list, servers, and code for administrator panels. The auctioneer claimed that Cerberus generated $10,000 in revenue per month. However, it seems there were no takers. \"Despite Cerberus' Russian speaking developers earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team,\" Kaspersky says. \"Due to an unclear culmination of factors, the author later decided to publish the project source code for premium users on a popular Russian-speaking underground forum.\" The cybersecurity firm says that following the free release of Cerberus source code in the underground, there was an \"immediate rise\" in mobile app infections across Europe and <e2>Russia</e2>.

Announced in a blog post, Facebook's action targeted a group of hackers known in the security community as Earth Empusa or Evil Eye. The collective, which has been linked to entities working for the Chinese government, deployed iOS and Android malware on a variety of websites in attempts to surveil devices owned by activists, journalists and dissidents. Uyghurs from Xinjiang who moved abroad were the main target of the group's activities. As noted by ArsTechnica, iPhones have been impacted by the attack since at least 2019.

It is still under active development, with at least 5 different versions of the Trojan released within the last 5 months (June - November 2019). What makes Ginp stand out is that it was built from scratch being expanded through regular updates, the last of which including code copied from the infamous Anubis banking Trojan, indicating that its author is cherry-picking the most relevant functionality for its malware. In addition, its original target list is extremely narrow and seems to be focused on Spanish banks. Last but not least, all the overlay screens (injects) for the banks include two steps; first stealing the victim\u2019s login credentials, then their credit card details. Although multi-step overlays are not something new, their usage is generally limited to avoid raising suspicion. Evolution The initial version of the malware dates back to early June 2019, masquerading as a \u201cGoogle Play Verificator\u201d app. At that time, Ginp was a simple SMS stealer whose purpose was only to send a copy of incoming and outgoing SMS messages to the C2 server. A couple of months later, in August 2019, a new version was released with additional banking-specific features. This and following versions were masquerading as fake \u201cAdobe Flash Player\u201d apps.

In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption.

Ad clicks The apps got past the Play Store's protection system, Google Bouncer, because they do not contain the malicious part of the Judy code. Once downloaded, the apps silently register the device to a remote server, which responds by sending back the malicious ad-click software to open a hidden website and generate revenue for the site by clicking on the adverts. This kind of delivery \"has become commonplace\", Andrew Smith, a senior lecturer in Networking at the Open University, told the <e2>BBC</e2>. \"There are many tools available, and the advantage is that the malware distributor can change them remotely, which makes it difficult for anti-malware software to keep up.

The current iteration of FakeSpy is also said to be more powerful and sophisticated than the original version, which is to say Android users should be particularly vigilant about avoiding suspicious messages. The manner by which FakeSpy spreads is quite clever and begins with an SMS message that claims to be from a local post office. The message claims that the post office tried to deliver a package but was unable to do so because a user wasn\u2019t home. It then provides a link users can click which directs them to download an app disguised as a legitimate postal service app. Once installed on a device, the app will then send the fake text, along with the malicious link, to a user\u2019s entire contact list. Once an unsuspecting user downloads the fake app, the malware essentially has full access to a user\u2019s device. Among other things, it can read text messages, send text messages, access contact information, and read from external storage. Beyond that, the app also makes a point to look for any banking or cryptocurrency-related apps so that it can steal login information.

Analysis of evasion techniques Along with the standard payload and string obfuscation, Cerberus uses a rather interesting technique to prevent analysis of the Trojan. Using the device accelerometer sensor it implements a simple pedometer that is used to measure movements of the victim. The idea is simple - if the infected device belongs to a real person, sooner or later this person will move around, increasing the step counter. The Trojan uses this counter to activate the bot - if aforementioned step counter hits the pre-configured threshold it considers running on the device to be safe. This simple measure prevents the Trojan from running and being analyzed in dynamic analysis environments (sandboxes) and on the test devices of malware analysts. The code responsible for this verification is shown in the following snippet: How it works When the malware is first started on the device it will begin by hiding its icon from the application drawer. Then it will ask for the accessibility service privilege as visible in the following screenshot: After the user grants the requested privilege, Cerberus starts to abuse it by granting itself additional permissions, such as permissions needed to send messages and make calls, without requiring any user interaction. It also disables <e2>Play Protect</e2> (Google\u2019s preinstalled antivirus solution) to prevent its discovery and deletion in the future.

Proofpoint wrote about the DroidJack RAT side-loaded with the Pokemon GO app back in July 2016; the difference here is that there is no game included in the malicious package. The authors are trying to latch onto the popularity of the Super Mario Run game to target eagerly waiting Android users. Details: Name : Super Mario Run Package Name : net.droidjack.server MD5 : 69b4b32e4636f1981841cbbe3b927560 Technical Analysis: The malicious package claims to be the Super Mario Run game, as shown in the permissions screenshot below, but in reality this is a malicious RAT called DroidJack (also known as SandroRAT) that is getting installed. DroidJack RAT starts capturing sensitive information like call data, SMS data, videos, photos, etc. Observe below the code routine for call recording. This RAT records all the calls and stores the recording to an \u201c.amr\u201d file. The following is the code routine for video capturing. Here, the RAT stores all the captured videos in a \u201cvideo.3gp\u201d file. It also harvests call details and SMS logs as shown below. Upon further inspection, we have observed that this RAT extracts WhatsApp data too. The RAT stores all the data in a database (DB) in order to send it to the Command & Control (C&C) server. The following are the DBs created and maintained by the RAT. We saw the following hardcoded C&C server location in the RAT package: Conclusion: The DroidJack RAT is another example of a growing trend in which malware authors seek to exploit public interest as a way to spread malware. In this case, like others before, the event of a popular game release became an opportunity to trick unsuspecting users into downloading the RAT.

The Android version is very similar to its iOS sister in terms of its capabilities, but different in terms of the techniques it uses to penetrate the device. Pegasus for Android does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities. Instead it uses a well-known rooting method called Framaroot. Another difference: If iOS version fails to jailbreak the device, the whole attack fails, but with the Android version, even if the malware fails to obtain the necessary root access to install surveillance software, it will still try directly asking the user for the permissions it needs to exfiltrate at least some data. Google claims that only a few dozen Android devices have been infected, but for a targeted cyberespionage attack, that\u2019s a lot.

Cerberus is a mobile banking Trojan designed for the Google Android operating system. In circulation since at least July 2019, the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is able to conduct covert surveillance, intercept communication, tamper with device functionality, and steal data including banking credentials by creating overlays on existing banking, retail, and social networking apps. The malware is able to read text messages that may contain one-time passcodes (OTP) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, thereby bypassing typical 2FA account protections. OTPs generated through Google Authenticator may also be stolen. In early July, Avast researchers discovered Cerberus in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices. Later in the same month, Hudson Rock spotted Cerberus going to auction. An advert was posted by the maintainer of the malware, revealing that the development team was breaking up, and so a new owner was being sought. The operator set a starting price of $50,000 -- with the aim of generating up to $100,000 -- for the malware's .APK source code, client list, servers, and code for administrator panels. The auctioneer claimed that Cerberus generated $10,000 in revenue per month. However, it seems there were no takers. \"Despite Cerberus' <e1>Russian speaking developers</e1> earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team,\" Kaspersky says.

HummingWhale, as the professionally developed malware has been dubbed, is a variant of HummingBad, the name given to a family of malicious apps researchers documented in July invading non-Google app markets. HummingBad attempted to override security protections by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities that gave the malware root privileges in older versions of Android. Before Google shut it down, it installed more than 50,000 fraudulent apps each day, displayed 20 million malicious advertisements, and generated more than $300,000 per month in revenue. Of the 10 million people who downloaded HummingBad-contaminated apps, an estimated 286,000 of them were located in the US. HummingWhale, by contrast, managed to sneak its way into about 20 Google Play apps that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times, according to researchers from Check Point, the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year.

In May 2020, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn\u2019t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, 2020 when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android\u2019s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction. In the same month, Cybereason analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named <e2>Eventbot</e2>, that abused Android\u2019s Accessibility features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication.

Anubis is one of the most widespread malwares plaguing these apps and devices, mainly targeting financial and banking apps available for the platform. Last year, researchers discovered two malicious apps, Currency Converter and BatterySaverMobo, that were infecting devices with Anubis to steal user credentials. At the time, researchers noted the trojan had been distributed to 93 different countries, targeting the users of 377 variations of financial apps to farm account details. Previous to that, <e2>IBM</e2>\u2019s X-Force team spotted Anubis in a campaign that used 10 malicious downloaders disguised as various Google Play applications to fetch the mobile banking trojan and run it on Android devices.

Then, the team probed tens of thousands of ISP DNS caches around the world, assuming that infected devices would routinely look up the domain names for the operator\u2019s servers using their ISP\u2019s DNS servers. \u201cWe designed and conducted a global DNS cache probing study on the matching domain names in order to identify in which countries each operator was spying,\u201d researchers said. \u201cOur technique identified a total of 45 countries where Pegasus operators may be conducting surveillance operations.

As for surveillance, let\u2019s be clear: We\u2019re talking total surveillance. Pegasus is modular malware. After scanning the target\u2019s device, it installs the necessary modules to read the user\u2019s messages and mail, listen to calls, capture screenshots, log pressed keys, exfiltrate browser history, contacts, and so on and so forth. Basically, it can spy on every aspect of the target\u2019s life. It\u2019s also noteworthy that Pegasus could even listen to encrypted audio streams and read encrypted messages \u2014 thanks to its keylogging and audio recording capabilities, it was stealing messages before they were encrypted (and, for incoming messages, after decryption). Another interesting fact about Pegasus is that it tries to hide itself really diligently. The malware self-destructs if it is not able to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server for more than 60 days, or if it detects that it was installed on the wrong device with the wrong SIM card (remember, this is targeted spying; NSO\u2019s clients weren\u2019t going after random victims). All the pretty horses Maybe the developers of Pegasus thought that they had invested too much in this project to limit it to one platform. After the first version was discovered, it didn\u2019t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on Pegasus for Android, also known as Chrysaor \u2014 that\u2019s what <e1>Google</e1> calls it.

Use of the virtual machine brings many technical benefits to the operators, chief among them allowing the malware to install apps without requiring users to approve a list of elevated permissions. The VM also disguises the malicious activity, making it easier for the apps to infiltrate Google Play.

Later in the same month, Hudson Rock spotted Cerberus going to auction. An advert was posted by the maintainer of the malware, revealing that the development team was breaking up, and so a new owner was being sought. The operator set a starting price of $50,000 -- with the aim of generating up to $100,000 -- for the malware's .APK source code, client list, servers, and code for administrator panels. The auctioneer claimed that Cerberus generated $10,000 in revenue per month. However, it seems there were no takers. \"Despite Cerberus' <e1>Russian speaking developers</e1> earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team,\" Kaspersky says.

Pegasus for Android does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities. Instead it uses a well-known rooting method called Framaroot. Another difference: If iOS version fails to jailbreak the device, the whole attack fails, but with the Android version, even if the malware fails to obtain the necessary root access to install surveillance software, it will still try directly asking the user for the permissions it needs to exfiltrate at least some data. Google claims that only a few dozen Android devices have been infected, but for a targeted cyberespionage attack, that\u2019s a lot.

Lookout's experts think, however, that there is plenty of evidence linking Monokle to STC. According to Lookout's technical report, STC is in the business of developing, among other things, a suite of defensive products for Android devices which is allegedly sold exclusively to Russian government agencies.

Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone.

Some of the countries currently targeted by the malware include China, France, Germany, the UK, and the United States. The current iteration of FakeSpy is also said to be more powerful and sophisticated than the original version, which is to say Android users should be particularly vigilant about avoiding suspicious messages. The manner by which FakeSpy spreads is quite clever and begins with an SMS message that claims to be from a local post office. The message claims that the post office tried to deliver a package but was unable to do so because a user wasn\u2019t home. It then provides a link users can click which directs them to download an app disguised as a legitimate postal service app. Once installed on a device, the app will then send the fake text, along with the malicious link, to a user\u2019s entire contact list. Once an unsuspecting user downloads the fake app, the malware essentially has full access to a user\u2019s device.

C2 and Targeted Banks As described earlier, the C2 domain is kept in the app\u2019s resources. During the app execution, the malware contacts C2 domain for further instructions. Most of the network traffic we\u2019ve observed is HTTP. The C2 address, as stored in samples we\u2019ve seen, comprise both an IP address and port number; So far, all the samples we\u2019ve tested attempted to contact an IP address on port 7878/tcp. If the main C2 domain is not responsive, the bot fetches a backup C2 domain from a Twitter account. Static analysis of the code reveals that the malware downloads the overlay template to use against any of the bank(s) it is targeting. The malware also sends regular telemetry back to its C2 server about the infected device in the form of an HTTP POST to its C2 server.

Nevertheless, users should practice proper security hygiene to mitigate threats that may take advantage of a home or business router\u2019s security gaps. Employ stronger credentials, for instance, to make them less susceptible to unauthorized access. Regularly update and patch the router\u2019s software and firmware to prevent exploits, and enable its built-in firewall.

Everyday users can do the same by checking the router\u2019s DNS settings if they\u2019ve been modified. Even threats like DNS cache poisoning employ social engineering, so users should also be more prudent against suspicious or unknown messages that have telltale signs of malware.

In the wild, we found Web pages designed to (vaguely) resemble legitimate app market pages, hosting files for download that have been disguised as a legitimate mobile application of moderately broad appeal, such as a media player or social media app. But the categories targeted by this group seem to be broadening with the inclusion of VPN software.

Pegasus for iPhone was uncovered in August last year, unprecedented in its use of three previously-undisclosed, then-unpatched iOS vulnerabilities (known as zero-days). It targeted a Mexican journalist and UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who's currently incarcerated in Abu Dhabi. NSO Group is a portfolio company of American private equity firm Francisco Partners, which Forbes discovered had its fingers in multiple surveillance firms, and in one case was accused of helping Turkey spy on its citizens' via internet service providers.

[SEP]", "[CLS] Click fraud apps The authors' tactics evolved from advertisement spam to real PHA (Click Fraud). <e2>Click fraud PHA</e2>s simulate user clicks on ads instead of simply displaying ads and waiting for users to click them. This allows the PHA authors to monetize their apps more effectively than through regular advertising. This behavior negatively impacts advertisement networks and their clients because advertising budget is spent without acquiring real customers, and impacts user experience by consuming their data plan resources. The click fraud PHA requests a URL to the advertising network directly instead of proxying it through an additional SDK. The command & control server (C&C server) returns the URL to click along with a very long list of additional parameters in JSON format. After rendering the ad on the screen, the app tries to identify the part of the advertisement website to click. If that part is found, the app loads Javascript snippets from the JSON parameters to click a button or other HTML element, simulating a real user click. Because a user interacting with an ad often leads to a higher chance of the user purchasing something, ad networks often \"pay per click\" to developers who host their ads. Therefore, by simulating fraudulent clicks, these developers are making money without requiring a user to click on an advertisement. Based on this JSON reply, the app looks for an HTML snippet that corresponds to the active element (show_hide btnnext) and, if found, the Javascript snippet tries to perform a click() method on it.

The current iteration of FakeSpy is also said to be more powerful and sophisticated than the original version, which is to say Android users should be particularly vigilant about avoiding suspicious messages. The manner by which FakeSpy spreads is quite clever and begins with an SMS message that claims to be from a local post office. The message claims that the post office tried to deliver a package but was unable to do so because a user wasn\u2019t home. It then provides a link users can click which directs them to download an app disguised as a legitimate postal service app. Once installed on a device, the app will then send the fake text, along with the malicious link, to a user\u2019s entire contact list. Once an unsuspecting user downloads the fake app, the malware essentially has full access to a user\u2019s device. Among other things, it can read text messages, send text messages, access contact information, and read from external storage. Beyond that, the app also makes a point to look for any banking or cryptocurrency-related apps so that it can steal login information.

Cerberus is a mobile banking Trojan designed for the Google Android operating system. In circulation since at least July 2019, the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is able to conduct covert surveillance, intercept communication, tamper with device functionality, and steal data including banking credentials by creating overlays on existing banking, retail, and social networking apps. The malware is able to read text messages that may contain one-time passcodes (OTP) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, thereby bypassing typical 2FA account protections. OTPs generated through Google Authenticator may also be stolen. In early July, Avast researchers discovered Cerberus in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices.

After thorough analysis we can confirm that Cerberus was indeed not based on the Anubis source code. One peculiar thing about the actor group behind this banking malware is that they have an \u201cofficial\u201d twitter account that they use to post promotional content (even videos) about the malware. Oddly enough they also use it to make fun of the AV community, sharing detection screenshots from VirusTotal (thus leaking IoC) and even engaging in discussions with malware researchers directly.

These accounts are created by abusing accessibility services. Zen apps gain access to root permissions from a rooting trojan in its infection chain. In this blog post, we do not differentiate between the rooting component and the component that abuses root: we refer to them interchangeably as Zen. We also describe apps that we think are coming from the same author or a group of authors. All of the PHAs that are mentioned in this blog post were detected and removed by Google Play Protect. Background Uncovering PHAs takes a lot of detective work and unraveling the mystery of how they're possibly connected to other apps takes even more. PHA authors usually try to hide their tracks, so attribution is difficult. Sometimes, we can attribute different apps to the same author based on a small, unique pieces of evidence that suggest similarity, such as a repetition of an exceptionally rare code snippet, asset, or a particular string in the debug logs. Every once in a while, authors leave behind a trace that allows us to attribute not only similar apps, but also multiple different PHA families to the same group or person. However, the actual timeline of the creation of different variants is unclear. In April 2013, we saw the first sample, which made heavy use of dynamic code loading (i.e., fetching executable code from remote sources after the initial app is installed). Dynamic code loading makes it impossible to state what kind of PHA it was. This sample displayed ads from various sources. More recent variants blend rooting capabilities and click fraud. As rooting exploits on Android become less prevalent and lucrative, PHA authors adapt their abuse or monetization strategy to focus on tactics like <e2>click fraud</e2>. This post doesn't follow the chronological evolution of Zen, but instead covers relevant samples from least to most complex.

The Android version is very similar to its iOS sister in terms of its capabilities, but different in terms of the techniques it uses to penetrate the device. Pegasus for Android does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities. Instead it uses a well-known rooting method called Framaroot. Another difference: If iOS version fails to jailbreak the device, the whole attack fails, but with the Android version, even if the malware fails to obtain the necessary root access to install surveillance software, it will still try directly asking the user for the permissions it needs to exfiltrate at least some data. Google claims that only a few dozen Android devices have been infected, but for a targeted cyberespionage attack, that\u2019s a lot. The greatest number of Pegasus for Android installations was observed in Israel, with Georgia in second place and Mexico third. Pegasus for Android was also spotted in Turkey, <e2>Kenya</e2>, Nigeria, UAE, and other countries.

All known targets have been alerted. While the iOS version removed itself if it detected a jailbreak, the Android tool would delete if it couldn't contact command and control servers for a set period of time. Or if certain tools, revealed by \"antidote files,\" that could detect the malware were spied by Pegasus, it would disappear. One of the samples, aimed at Samsung phones, removed the manufacturer's system update app to prevent security fixes from disrupting its snooping. <e2>Flossman</e2> believes that Pegasus for Android was delivered in a similar fashion to its iPhone equivalent, via an SMS message.

The apps contain code that sends infected devices to a target webpage, where they generate fraudulent clicks on the site's adverts to make money for its creators. The infected apps have been removed from the Play Store. More than 40 of the apps were from the South Korean developer, Kiniwini, which publishes games to the Play Store under the name Enistudio. The games, all of which feature a character called Judy, have been downloaded between four million and 18 million times. 'Hid undetected' The malicious code was also found in several apps from other developers. \"It is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly,\" said Check Point. Between them, the infected apps may have been downloaded up to 36.5 million times. Check Point said it did not know for how long the malicious versions of the apps had been available, but all the Judy games had been updated since March this year. The oldest of the apps from other developers was last updated in April 2016, which Check Point suggested, means that \"the malicious code hid for a long time on the Play Store undetected\". Because it is unclear when the code was introduced to each of the apps, the actual number of devices likely to have been infected is unknown. Ad clicks The apps got past the Play Store's protection system, Google Bouncer, because they do not contain the malicious part of the Judy code. Once downloaded, the apps silently register the device to a remote server, which responds by sending back the malicious ad-click software to open a hidden website and generate revenue for the site by clicking on the adverts.

The new feature is one of several that haven\u2019t been released in the wild yet but are a part of an updated control panel for the malware that\u2019s currently in development, researchers from security consulting firm Hold Security discovered, according to a report published online. The panel is a web-based module that explores devices that have already been infiltrated by Anubis, researchers said. Threat actors use it to view and decide from which device they want to steal data as well as which services on devices to target. The new control panel will add features that provide even more insight so attackers can fully take advantage of a device, Alex Holden, founder and chief information security officer of Hold Security, told Bank Info Security. One key addition to the malware is a small eyeball icon included in the control panel that can be used to recognize whether a user of a device with Anubis installed is looking at the device or not. The idea is that an attacker won\u2019t perform any nefarious activity on the device while the person is looking at it, he said. The threat actors behind Anubis also are developing a way to integrate Yandex maps into the malware to show the location of infected devices, according to the report. However, this could be a superfluous addition, as the mobile network to which a device is attached is usually can tell a hacker where the phone is located, Holden noted in the report. Anubis malware has been active since late 2017. The sophisticated malware originally was used for cyber-espionage and later repurposed as a banking trojan. The most widespread campaign last seen using Anubis was in February, a new phishing campaign targeting more than 250 Android apps was aimed at using the <e2>trojan</e2> to steal user credentials, install a keylogger, and even hold a device\u2019s data for ransom.

Due to this Cerberus will come in handy for actors that want to focus on performing fraud without having to develop and maintain a botnet and C2 infrastructure. Analysis of evasion techniques Along with the standard payload and string obfuscation, Cerberus uses a rather interesting technique to prevent analysis of the Trojan. Using the device accelerometer sensor it implements a simple pedometer that is used to measure movements of the victim. The idea is simple - if the infected device belongs to a real person, sooner or later this person will move around, increasing the step counter. The Trojan uses this counter to activate the bot - if aforementioned step counter hits the pre-configured threshold it considers running on the device to be safe. This simple measure prevents the Trojan from running and being analyzed in dynamic analysis environments (sandboxes) and on the test devices of malware analysts. The code responsible for this verification is shown in the following snippet: How it works When the malware is first started on the device it will begin by hiding its icon from the application drawer. Then it will ask for the accessibility service privilege as visible in the following screenshot: After the user grants the requested privilege, Cerberus starts to abuse it by granting itself additional permissions, such as permissions needed to send messages and make calls, without requiring any user interaction.

It is still under active development, with at least 5 different versions of the Trojan released within the last 5 months (June - November 2019). What makes Ginp stand out is that it was built from scratch being expanded through regular updates, the last of which including code copied from the infamous Anubis banking Trojan, indicating that its author is cherry-picking the most relevant functionality for its malware.

That means the malware is commercial \u2014 it\u2019s sold to whoever is willing to pay for it. Pegasus relied on a whopping three zero-day (previously unknown) vulnerabilities in iOS that allowed it to silently jailbreak the device and install surveillance software. Another cybersecurity firm, Zerodium, once offered $1 million for an iOS zero-day, so you can imagine that it cost quite a bit of money to create Pegasus. As for surveillance, let\u2019s be clear: We\u2019re talking total surveillance. Pegasus is modular malware. After scanning the target\u2019s device, it installs the necessary modules to read the user\u2019s messages and mail, listen to calls, capture screenshots, log pressed keys, exfiltrate browser history, contacts, and so on and so forth. Basically, it can spy on every aspect of the target\u2019s life. It\u2019s also noteworthy that Pegasus could even listen to encrypted audio streams and read encrypted messages \u2014 thanks to its keylogging and audio recording capabilities, it was stealing messages before they were encrypted (and, for incoming messages, after decryption). Another interesting fact about Pegasus is that it tries to hide itself really diligently. The malware self-destructs if it is not able to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server for more than 60 days, or if it detects that it was installed on the wrong device with the wrong SIM card (remember, this is targeted spying; NSO\u2019s clients weren\u2019t going after random victims). All the pretty horses Maybe the developers of Pegasus thought that they had invested too much in this project to limit it to one platform. After the first version was discovered, it didn\u2019t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on Pegasus for Android, also known as <e2>Chrysaor</e2> \u2014 that\u2019s what Google calls it.

The source code of the Cerberus banking Trojan has been released as free malware on underground hacking forums following a failed auction. Speaking at Kaspersky NEXT 2020 on Wednesday, Kaspersky cybersecurity researcher Dmitry Galov said that the leaked code, distributed under the name Cerberus v2, presents an increased threat for smartphone users and the banking sector at large. Cerberus is a mobile banking Trojan designed for the Google Android operating system. In circulation since at least July 2019, the Remote Access Trojan (RAT) is able to conduct covert surveillance, intercept communication, tamper with device functionality, and steal data including banking credentials by creating overlays on existing banking, retail, and social networking apps. The malware is able to read text messages that may contain one-time passcodes (OTP) and two-factor authentication (2FA) codes, thereby bypassing typical 2FA account protections. OTPs generated through Google Authenticator may also be stolen. In early July, Avast researchers discovered Cerberus in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices. Later in the same month, Hudson Rock spotted Cerberus going to auction. An advert was posted by the maintainer of the malware, revealing that the development team was breaking up, and so a new owner was being sought. The operator set a starting price of $50,000 -- with the aim of generating up to $100,000 -- for the malware's .APK source code, client list, servers, and code for administrator panels. The auctioneer claimed that Cerberus generated $10,000 in revenue per month. However, it seems there were no takers. \"Despite Cerberus' <e1>Russian speaking developers</e1> earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team,\" Kaspersky says.

Using a publicly available rooting framework, the PHA attempts to root devices and gain persistence on them by reinstalling itself on the system partition of rooted device. Installing apps on the system partition makes it harder for the user to remove the app. This technique only works for unpatched devices running Android 4.3 or lower. Devices running Android 4.4 and higher are protected by Verified Boot. Zen's rooting trojan apps target a specific device model with a very specific system image. After achieving root access the app tries to replace the framework.jar file on the system partition. Replicating framework.jar allows the app to intercept and modify the behavior of the Android standard API. In particular, these apps try to add an additional method called statistics() into the Activity class. When inserted, this method runs every time any Activity object in any Android app is created. This happens all the time in regular Android apps, as Activity is one of the fundamental Android UI elements. The only purpose of this method is to connect to the C&C server. The Zen trojan After achieving persistence, the trojan downloads additional payloads, including another trojan called Zen. Zen requires root to work correctly on the Android operating system. The Zen trojan uses its root privileges to turn on accessibility service (a service used to allow Android users with disabilities to use their devices) for itself by writing to a system-wide setting value enabled_accessibility_services. Zen doesn't even check for the root privilege: it just assumes it has it. This leads us to believe that Zen is just part of a larger infection chain. The trojan implements three accessibility services directed at different Android API levels and uses these accessibility services, chosen by checking the operating system version, to create new Google accounts.

A simple WHOIS query of AnubisSpy\u2019s C&C server showed it abused a legitimate managed hosting service provider in Belize. We correlated the AnubisSpy variants to Sphinx\u2019s desktop/PC-targeting malware through the following: Shared C&C server, 86[.]105[.]18[.]107 Shared technique of decrypting JSON files, and similarity between the file structures of AnubisSpy and Sphinx\u2019s malware Similar targets (highly concentrated in Middle Eastern countries) These apps were all written in Arabic and, in one way or another, related to something in Egypt (i.e., spoofing an Egypt-based TV program and using news/stories in the Middle East) regardless of the labels and objects in the apps. Our coordination with Google also revealed that these apps were installed across a handful of countries in the Middle East. Was AnubisSpy actively distributed? We analyzed seven apps that were actually AnubisSpy. These were signed with the same fake Google certificates. We found two more apps created by the same developer, but they had no espionage-related codes; we think they were made as experimental projects. Based on hardcoded strings in the Agent Version, the malicious apps were developed as early as April 2015. Timestamps indicate that the earliest sample was signed on June 2015; the latest variant was signed on May 2017. AnubisSpy wasn\u2019t only published on Google Play. We also found versions of it in third-party app marketplaces, most likely as a way to expand the malware\u2019s reach. The apps mainly used Middle East-based news and sociopolitical themes as social engineering hooks and abused social media to further proliferate.

[SEP]", "[CLS] DEFENSOR ID - A new threat ESET researchers have detected a new Android malware strain called \u201cDEFENSOR ID\u201d that abuses the Android\u2019s Accessibility Service to perform a host of nefarious actions and give hackers the privilege of notably wiping out the victim\u2019s cryptocurrency wallet or bank account and taking over their email or social media accounts. In <e2>May 2020</e2>, DEFENSOR ID malware was observed pretending as a security application and claiming to increase user security by using end-to-end encryption. The malware operator dropped all other potentially suspicious features, except one, they asked for the permissions to access the Accessibility Service. Due to its exceptional stealth, the app got into the official Google Play store. The malware developers named themselves as GAS Brazil. They were probably trying to fake themselves as the well-known Brazilian anti-fraud solution provider GAS Tecnologia, as they targeted Brazilian users. How wide the impact is According to the Sciendo report, turning on the Accessibility Services leaves 72 % of the top finance and 80 % of the top social media apps vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, leaking sensitive information such as logins and passwords. This indicate that most of the commonly used finance and social media apps are impacted due to this malware. Not the first time This isn\u2019t the first time when Android malware has abused Accessibility Services. There have been several incidents within, 2020 when security researchers have witnessed Android malware abusing Accessibility Service. In April 2020, Check Point Research found a Malware-as-a-Service (MaaS) botnet and a dropper for Android devices, dubbed Black Rose Lucy, that primarily leveraged Android\u2019s Accessibility Service using a fake Streaming Video Optimization (SVO) prompt to install their payload without any user interaction. In the same month, Cybereason analyzed a new type of Android mobile banking Trojan named <e1>Eventbot</e1>, that abused Android\u2019s Accessibility features to steal user data from financial apps, read and steal user SMS messages to allow the malware to bypass two-factor authentication. [SEP]", "[CLS] FakeSpy Targets <e2>Japanese</e2> and Korean-Speaking Users Spoofing legitimate mobile applications is a common cybercriminal modus that banks on their popularity and relies on their users\u2019 trust to steal information or deliver payloads. Cybercriminals typically use third-party app marketplaces to distribute their malicious apps, but in operations such as the ones that distributed CPUMINER, BankBot, and <e1>MilkyDoor</e1>, they would try to get their apps published on Google Play or App Store. [SEP]", "[CLS] It is believed that quite a few talented, sophisticated experts work for STC, and researchers from security company Lookout seem convinced that the same experts are responsible for the creation of a previously undocumented strain of Android malware called Monokle. <e1>Monokle</e1> and the STC connection As we'll find out in a minute, Monokle is an extremely sophisticated and versatile piece of mobile surveillanceware, and because such malicious apps are usually developed by people who know what they're doing, often, attributing them to a specific group of hackers is next to impossible. Lookout's experts think, however, that there is plenty of evidence linking Monokle to STC. According to Lookout's technical report, STC is in the business of developing, among other things, a suite of defensive products for Android devices which is allegedly sold exclusively to <e2>Russian government agencies</e2>. The company also has a control panel application called App Control through which the rest of STC's services are managed. [SEP]", "[CLS] A Trustwave report published this week reveals that the malware author is currently advertising the Trojan as targeting nearly 120 banks in <e2>Australia</e2>, Austria, Canada, Czech Republic, Poland, Denmark, Germany, France, Lithuania, India, Italy, Ireland, Japan, New Zeeland, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States. Additionally, the malware developer claims the Trojan is targeting payment systems (PayPal, Airbnb, Coinbase, Poker Stars, Neteller, Skrill, and Unocoin Bitcoin Wallet India) and CC+VBV Grabbers (Amazon, eBay, LINE, GetTaxi, Snapchat, Viber, Instagram, Facebook, Skype, UBER, WeChat, and WhatsApp) too. Red Alert 2.0 is also advertised as able to intercept and send SMS messages and launch APKs. The author also claims new functionality is being developed, that injects can be built per customer request, and that updates are being released every two weeks. Miscreants can rent the Trojan starting at $200 for 7 days, $500 for a month, or $999 for 2 months. As part of the analyzed Red Alert 2.0 attack, the malware was being distributed attached to spam messages. Although the threat is currently detected by nearly half of the <e1>VirusTotal</e1> anti-virus companies, the distribution method is still interesting for an Android malware family.

AnubisSpy\u2019s code is well constructed, indicating the developer/s\u2019 know-how. Below is a visualization of the modules: How is AnubisSpy related to Sphinx? Sphinx reportedly uses the watering hole technique via social media sites to deliver its payloads \u2014 mainly a customized version of njRAT. The Sphinx campaign operators cloaked the malware with icons of legitimate applications to dupe recipients into clicking them. Sphinx was active between June 2014 and November 2015, but timestamps of the malware indicate the attacks started as early as 2011. A simple WHOIS query of AnubisSpy\u2019s C&C server showed it abused a legitimate managed hosting service provider in Belize. We correlated the AnubisSpy variants to Sphinx\u2019s desktop/PC-targeting malware through the following: Shared C&C server, 86[.]105[.]18[.]107 Shared technique of decrypting JSON files, and similarity between the file structures of AnubisSpy and Sphinx\u2019s malware Similar targets (highly concentrated in Middle Eastern countries) These apps were all written in Arabic and, in one way or another, related to something in Egypt (i.e., spoofing an Egypt-based TV program and using news/stories in the Middle East) regardless of the labels and objects in the apps. Our coordination with Google also revealed that these apps were installed across a handful of countries in the Middle East. Was AnubisSpy actively distributed? We analyzed seven apps that were actually AnubisSpy. These were signed with the same fake Google certificates. We found two more apps created by the same developer, but they had no espionage-related codes; we think they were made as experimental projects. Based on hardcoded strings in the Agent Version, the malicious apps were developed as early as April 2015. Timestamps indicate that the earliest sample was signed on <e2>June 2015</e2>; the latest variant was signed on May 2017.

In early July, Avast researchers discovered Cerberus in Google Play, wrapped up and disguised as a legitimate currency converter. It is thought that when the application was submitted to Google for approval, the functions were innocent and legitimate -- but once a large user base was established, an update package deployed the Trojan on victim devices. Later in the same month, Hudson Rock spotted Cerberus going to auction. An advert was posted by the maintainer of the malware, revealing that the development team was breaking up, and so a new owner was being sought. The operator set a starting price of $50,000 -- with the aim of generating up to $100,000 -- for the malware's .APK source code, client list, servers, and code for administrator panels. The auctioneer claimed that Cerberus generated $10,000 in revenue per month. However, it seems there were no takers. \"Despite Cerberus' Russian speaking developers earmarking a new vision for the project in April this year, auctions for the source code began in late July due to the breakup of the development team,\" Kaspersky says. \"Due to an unclear culmination of factors, the author later decided to publish the project source code for premium users on a popular Russian-speaking underground forum.\" The cybersecurity firm says that following the free release of Cerberus source code in the underground, there was an \"immediate rise\" in mobile app infections across Europe and Russia. Of particular note, Galov says, is that previous clients were not encouraged to strike <e2>Russian</e2> mobile device users -- but the moment the code was released, the attack landscape changed.

[SEP]", "[CLS] Researchers from The <e1>Citizen Lab</e1> scanned the internet in a massive project that took place between 2016 and 2018, sniffing out servers associated with the Pegasus mobile spyware, attributed to Israel-based company NSO Group as an offering for state-level actors around the world. \u201cThe number of Pegasus servers we detected in our scans ballooned from about 200 in 2016 to almost 600 in 2018. This may be an indication that NSO Group is scaling up their operations,\u201d Bill Marczak, senior research fellow at The Citizens Lab and one of the researchers on the team, told Threatpost. The malware has been active since August 2016 when it was discovered that the NSO Group was selling the mobile spyware to governments and third-parties who wanted its surveillance capabilities in order to read texts, track calls, collect passwords, trace phone locations and gather data from apps of victims. Pegasus is generally spread through a specially crafted exploit link (via phishing techniques) which when clicked delivers a chain of zero-day exploits to penetrate security features on the phone. The Citizen Lab\u2019s latest report shows that Pegasus has grown more widespread \u2013 and alleges that it\u2019s being used by certain countries to target human rights. That includes the expansion of Pegasus usage in Gulf Cooperation Council countries in the Middle East \u2013 particularly to track dissidents, such as UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who was targeted by the spyware in 2016; and an Amnesty International staffer and Saudi activist in June 2018. \u201cOur findings paint a bleak picture of the human-rights risks of NSO\u2019s global proliferation,\u201d researchers said in a Tuesday post. \u201cAt least six countries with significant Pegasus operations have previously been linked to abusive use of spyware to target civil society, including Bahrain, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Morocco, <e2>Saudi Arabia</e2> and the United Arab Emirates. [SEP]", "[CLS] Check Point said it did not know for how long the malicious versions of the apps had been available, but all the <e1>Judy</e1> games had been updated since <e2>March</e2> this year. [SEP]", "[CLS] The malware self-destructs if it is not able to communicate with its command-and-control (C&C) server for more than 60 days, or if it detects that it was installed on the wrong device with the wrong SIM card (remember, this is targeted spying; <e1>NSO</e1>\u2019s clients weren\u2019t going after random victims). All the pretty horses Maybe the developers of Pegasus thought that they had invested too much in this project to limit it to one platform. After the first version was discovered, it didn\u2019t take long to find the second, and at the Security Analyst Summit 2017, Lookout researchers had a talk on Pegasus for Android, also known as Chrysaor \u2014 that\u2019s what Google calls it. The Android version is very similar to its iOS sister in terms of its capabilities, but different in terms of the techniques it uses to penetrate the device. Pegasus for Android does not rely on zero-day vulnerabilities. Instead it uses a well-known rooting method called Framaroot. Another difference: If iOS version fails to jailbreak the device, the whole attack fails, but with the Android version, even if the malware fails to obtain the necessary root access to install surveillance software, it will still try directly asking the user for the permissions it needs to exfiltrate at least some data. Google claims that only a few dozen Android devices have been infected, but for a targeted cyberespionage attack, that\u2019s a lot. The greatest number of Pegasus for Android installations was observed in Israel, with Georgia in second place and Mexico third. Pegasus for Android was also spotted in Turkey, <e2>Kenya</e2>, Nigeria, UAE, and other countries.

It targeted a Mexican journalist and UAE activist Ahmed Mansoor, who's currently incarcerated in Abu Dhabi. <e2>NSO Group</e2> is a portfolio company of American private equity firm Francisco Partners, which Forbes discovered had its fingers in multiple surveillance firms, and in one case was accused of helping Turkey spy on its citizens' via internet service providers.
