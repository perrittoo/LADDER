A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that\u2019s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won\u2019t be able to continue to use their bank\u2019s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone\u2019s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK BRAND].

They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name \u201cstart.\u201d The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res \u2013 and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called \u201ccommon\u201d. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app \u201ccom.qualcmm.timeservices.\u201d These archives contain the file \u201c.root.sh\u201d which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the \u201cstart\u201d file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or Game644.res). In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights. But the malicious ip file does not contain any methods from the original ip file. This means that all apps that were using this file will lose some functionality or even start crashing. Malicious module \u201cip\u201d This file will be executed by the patched system library. It can turn off \u201cVerifyApps\u201d and enable the installation of apps from 3rd party stores by changing system settings. Furthermore, it can grant the \u201ccom.qualcmm.timeservices\u201d app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands. It is a very unusual way to get Device Administrator rights. Malicious app com.qualcmm.timeservices As I mentioned before, in the \u201cinitial phase\u201d, the Trojan will install the \u201ccom.qualcmm.timeservices\u201d app. Its main purpose is to download archives and execute the \u201cstart\u201d binary from them. During the investigation, this app was able to successfully connect to the command and control server, but it received no commands. So I don\u2019t know what kind of files will be executed, but they could be malicious or advertising files. Conclusions This Trojan was distributed through the Google Play Store and uses a number of very dangerous techniques, including patching system libraries. It installs malicious modules with different functionality into the system. It looks like its main purpose is to get into the system and execute downloaded files with root rights. But I never received such files from their command and control server. These malicious modules report to the attackers about every step they are going to make. So I think that the authors are still testing this malware, because they use some techniques which can break the infected devices. But they already have a lot of infected users on whom to test their methods. I hope that by uncovering this malware at such an early stage, we will be able to prevent a massive and dangerous attack when the attackers are ready to actively use their methods.

With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan\u2019s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan\u2019s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan\u2019s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015\u20132016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format \u201c/[number]\u201d (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0\u20139999).

This allows the application to appear legitimate, especially given these applications icons and user interface. FAKESPY CODE ANALYSIS Once the user clicks on the malicious link from the SMS message, the app asks them to approve installation from unknown resources.

PackageInstaller shows the app\u2019s permission access and asks for the user's approval, which then installs the application. This analysis dissects FakeSpy\u2019s Chunghwa Post app version, which emerged in April 2020. During the installation, the malware asks for the following permissions: READ_PHONE_STATE - Allows read-only access to the phone state, including the current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any PhoneAccounts registered on the device. READ_SMS - Allows the application to read text messages. RECEIVE_SMS - Allows the application to receive SMS messages. WRITE_SMS - Allows the application to write to SMS messages stored on the device or SIM card, including y deleting messages. SEND_SMS - Allows the application to send SMS messages. INTERNET - Allows the application to open network sockets. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to write to external storage. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to read from external storage. RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - Allows the application to receive a broadcast after the system finishes booting. GET_TASKS - Allows the application to get information about current or recently run tasks. (deprecated in API level 21) SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW - Allows the application to create windows shown on top of all other apps. WAKE_LOCK - Allows the application to use PowerManager WakeLocks to keep the processor from sleeping or the screen from dimming. ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - Allows the application to access information about networks. REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS - Whitelists the application to allow it to ignore battery optimizations. READ_CONTACTS - Allows the application to read the user's contacts data. On opening the app, two pop-up messages appear on screen: Change SMS App: This sets permissions to intercept every SMS received on the device and send a copy of these messages to the C2 server. Ignore Battery Optimization: This sets permissions to continue to operate at full capacity while the phone's screen is turned off and the phone locked. These requests rely on the end user accepting the permission changes and points to the importance of healthy skepticism when giving applications permissions. DYNAMIC LIBRARY LOADING Once the application has finished the installation process, the malware starts its real malicious activity. The malicious application da.hao.pao.bin (Chunghwa Post) loads a library file libmsy.so used to execute the packed mycode.jar file. The JAR file is the decrypted version of the file tong.luo, which is located in the assets folder. By comparing the sizes of the encrypted asset file tong.luo vs the decrypted JAR file mycode.jar, it is interesting to note that it is the same file (almost the same size).

We believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago \u2013 at the end of 2014. Since then, the implant\u2019s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals.

With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan\u2019s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan\u2019s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan\u2019s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015\u20132016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format \u201c/[number]\u201d (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0\u20139999). In some samples, starting from January 2016, an algorithm has been implemented for unpacking the encrypted executable DEX file from the assets folder. In this version of Rotexy, dynamic generation of lowest-level domains was not used. 2016 From mid-2016 on, the cybercriminals returned to dynamic generation of lowest-level domains. No other significant changes were observed in the Trojan\u2019s network behavior.

Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them.

The researchers said that attackers used Smali injection technique, that allows hackers to disassemble the code of an original application and add malicious code. \u201cIn May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,\u201d Kaspersky said in a statement. A similar research from Kaspersky revealed that the number of Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks increased by 84 percent in the first quarter of 2019 compared to Q4 of 2018. In its research report dubbed DDoS Attacks in Q1 2019, Kaspersky stated that cybercriminals are once again turning to DDoS attacks after a sustained time period. The Moscow-based cybersecurity firm also revealed that it discovered a considerable growth in the number of attacks that lasted more than an hour. According to the research findings, China reported the highest number of DDoS attacks (67%) while the <e2>U.S.</e2> reported the second largest attacks (17.", "Security researchers from Trustwave who identified the malware said in a report, \u201cOut of 59 anti-virus products, only 25 of them flagged the application.\u201d <e1>Red Alerts 2.0</e1> malware is currently targeting more than 120 banks from several countries including the <e2>U.S</e2>, U.", "Rotexy. <e1>Rotexy</e1>\u2019s key ability has always been to intercept and read SMS messages, as well as track a list of all running processes and installed applications (including the possible tracking of antivirus or banking applications).

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command \"40\" and the names of apps. We noticed that command \"40\" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 hellowopung[.]com 102 5 quostpeopls[.]com 24 6 <e1>bannerincbest[.]com</e1> 102 7 campuphome[.", "This malware works same as the <e1>Flu Bot</e1> threat which is still out there in the United Kingdom as well as in <e2>Europe</e2>.

Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple\u2019s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple\u2019s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise\u2019s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to \u201ckeep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators\u201d. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered. In particular, these packages have not been observed to contain or to download exploits which would be required to perform certain types of activities on iOS devices. Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user\u2019s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically. Upload data was queued and transmitted via HTTP PUT requests to an endpoint on the C2. The iOS apps leverage the same C2 infrastructure as the Android version and use similar communications protocols. Push notifications were also used to control audio recording. Lookout has shared information about this family with Apple, and they have revoked the affected certificates. As a result, no new instances of this app can be installed on <e2>iOS</e2> devices and existing installations can no longer be run.", "According to the Times, \u201cpeople familiar with its sales pitch\u201d as well as leaked sales documents show that NSO Group\u2019s parent company Q-Cyber is advertising <e1>Pegasus</e1> as having the capability to copy authentication keys to services including <e2>Google Drive</e2>, Facebook Messenger, and iCloud from an infected phone to a web server that is then capable of independently downloading the target\u2019s entire online history.", "Our analysis shows that <e2>SpyDealer</e2><e1>SpyDealer</e1> is currently under active development.", "Once fully installed, <e1>Exodus</e1> was able to carry out an extensive amount of surveillance, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from <e2>Chrome</e2> and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones) Extract events from the Calendar app Extract the calls log Record phone calls audio in 3gp format Take pictures with the embedded camera Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS) Extract the address book Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations Take a screenshot of any app in foreground Extract information on pictures from the Gallery Extract information from the Gmail app Dump data from the IMO messenger app Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app Retrieve all SMS messages Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app Dump data from the Viber messenger app Extract logs from WhatsApp Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp Extract the Wi-Fi network's password Extract data from WeChat app Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone The missing iOS link discovered In a blog post expected to be published Monday, researchers from mobile security provider said their analysis of Exodus led to the discovery of servers that, in addition to Exodux, hosted an iOS version of the malware.", "The developer behind <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> also claims the Trojan can target multiple payment systems, retail applications and social media apps such as PayPal, <e2>Airbnb</e2>, Amazon, eBay, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, Uber and more.", "In the Android version, however, the attackers built in functionality that would allow <e1>Pegasus</e1> for <e2>Android</e2> to still ask for permissions that would then allow it to access and exfiltrate data.", "Volexity refers to this implant by the name <e2>INSOMNIA</e2>.

Conclusion The \u201cCorona Updates\u201d app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app\u2019s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a \u201cright time\u201d to inject the malicious codes. It\u2019s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and \u201cincubation.\u201d As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app\u2019s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command \"40\" and the names of apps. We noticed that command \"40\" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php.

To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to \"trick\" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen Signal data. The data stolen from the Signal app is as follows: Images transferred using Signal (these are unencrypted on the phone) A copy of the messages, stored in an SQLite3 database (these are encrypted on the phone) The messages require a key from the phones keychain in order to be successfully decrypted. In the Volexity test environment, the required key was not automatically exfiltrated, perhaps showing a shortcoming in the attackers' thinking. Over time, the IP addresses the malware was configured to communicate with, ports, and certificates used to verify the server were modified.

Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The \u201cCorona Updates\u201d app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app\u2019s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a \u201cright time\u201d to inject the malicious codes. It\u2019s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and \u201cincubation.\u201d As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app\u2019s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them.

A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that\u2019s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won\u2019t be able to continue to use their bank\u2019s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone\u2019s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access.

Let\u2019s take a closer look at the suspicious file. When the email link is opened from an Android device, an APK file (Fattura002873.apk), is downloaded. Upon opening the file, the user is asked to enable \u201cGoogle Play Protect\u201d as shown in Figure 2. However, this is not a genuine \u201cGoogle Play Protect\u201d screen; instead it gives the app all the permissions it needs while simultaneously disabling the actual Google Play Protect.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded.

To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to \"trick\" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen Signal data. The data stolen from the Signal app is as follows: Images transferred using Signal (these are unencrypted on the phone) A copy of the messages, stored in an SQLite3 database (these are encrypted on the phone) The messages require a key from the phones keychain in order to be successfully decrypted. In the Volexity test environment, the required key was not automatically exfiltrated, perhaps showing a shortcoming in the attackers' thinking. Over time, the IP addresses the malware was configured to communicate with, ports, and certificates used to verify the server were modified. Functionality & Targeted Applications As described in the Project Zero and CitizenLab posts, the malware contains a list of applications for which it will steal data automatically if they are installed. Since the last analysis, the following applications have been added to this list: Signal (org.whispersystems.signal) ProtonMail (ch.protonmail.protonmail) The inclusion of these apps suggests they are being more commonly used by the Uyghur community than before. In particular, the inclusion of Signal and ProtonMail may suggest that the Uyghurs are aware of potential monitoring of their communications and are attempting to use applications with strong security features to avoid this. It is also worth noting that this implant also targets the popular messaging app WeChat. This app is referenced as \"com.tencent.xin\" in other write-ups, but it is not mentioned as <e2>WeChat</e2>. Volexity also noted that the malware has no mechanism for persistence.", "What we found were several other fake apps developed using the <e1>SpyNote</e1> builder, which should come as a warning to Android users.

As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, Asia and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, <e2>North-America</e2> and Australia.", "]ee, is the same one used in the Android version of <e2>Project Spy</e2>. However, although the \u201cConcipit1248\u201d app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the \u201cConcipit1248\u201d app is still incubating. The other iOS app \u201cConcipit Shop\u201d from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The \u201cCorona Updates\u201d app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app\u2019s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a \u201cright time\u201d to inject the malicious codes. It\u2019s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and \u201cincubation.\u201d As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps.

They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name \u201cstart.\u201d The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res \u2013 and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called \u201ccommon\u201d. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app \u201ccom.qualcmm.timeservices.\u201d These archives contain the file \u201c.root.sh\u201d which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the \u201cstart\u201d file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or Game644.res). In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights. But the malicious ip file does not contain any methods from the original ip file. This means that all apps that were using this file will lose some functionality or even start crashing. Malicious module \u201cip\u201d This file will be executed by the patched system library. It can turn off \u201cVerifyApps\u201d and enable the installation of apps from 3rd party stores by changing system settings. Furthermore, it can grant the \u201ccom.qualcmm.timeservices\u201d app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands. It is a very unusual way to get Device Administrator rights. Malicious app com.qualcmm.timeservices As I mentioned before, in the \u201cinitial phase\u201d, the Trojan will install the \u201ccom.qualcmm.timeservices\u201d app. Its main purpose is to download archives and execute the \u201cstart\u201d binary from them. During the investigation, this app was able to successfully connect to the command and control server, but it received no commands. So I don\u2019t know what kind of files will be executed, but they could be malicious or advertising files. Conclusions This Trojan was distributed through the Google Play Store and uses a number of very dangerous techniques, including patching system libraries. It installs malicious modules with different functionality into the system. It looks like its main purpose is to get into the system and execute downloaded files with root rights. But I never received such files from their command and control server. These malicious modules report to the attackers about every step they are going to make. So I think that the authors are still testing this malware, because they use some techniques which can break the infected devices. But they already have a lot of infected users on whom to test their methods. I hope that by uncovering this malware at such an early stage, we will be able to prevent a massive and dangerous attack when the attackers are ready to actively use their methods.

The detected malware samples were disguised as a legitimate messaging app offered through Google Play. The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn\u2019t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don\u2019t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed.

Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple\u2019s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple\u2019s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise\u2019s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to \u201ckeep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators\u201d. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered. In particular, these packages have not been observed to contain or to download exploits which would be required to perform certain types of activities on iOS devices. Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user\u2019s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically. Upload data was queued and transmitted via HTTP PUT requests to an endpoint on the C2. The iOS apps leverage the same C2 infrastructure as the Android version and use similar communications protocols. Push notifications were also used to control audio recording. Lookout has shared information about this family with Apple, and they have revoked the affected certificates. As a result, no new instances of this app can be installed on iOS devices and existing installations can no longer be run. Lookout customers are also protected from this threat on both <e2>Android</e2> and iOS.", "The newly uncovered banking <e1>Alien</e1> trojan is \u2018invading\u2019 Android devices worldwide, using an advanced ability to bypass 2-factor authentication (2FA) security measures to steal victim credentials!

However, binding a shell on all available interfaces will obviously make it accessible to anyone who is sharing at least a local network with an infected device. For example, if an infected device is connected to a public Wi-Fi network any other host will be able to obtain a terminal on the device without any form of authentication or verification by simply connecting to the port. If the mobile operator doesn't enforce proper client isolation, it is possible that the infected devices are also exposed to the rest of the cellular network. Obviously, this inevitably leaves the device open not only to further compromise but to data tampering as well. null is not the only payload opening a shell on the phone.

Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won\u2019t be able to continue to use their bank\u2019s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone\u2019s camera.

It\u2019s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and \u201cincubation.\u201d As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command \"40\" and the names of apps. We noticed that command \"40\" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 hellowopung[.]com 102 5 quostpeopls[.]com 24 6 bannerincbest[.]com 102 7 campuphome[.]com 9 8 <e1>wewelowertick[.]com</e1> 3 9 bigslogous[.", "DroidJack: The Stalker's App Targeting Android Users An international cybercrime investigation is currently underway to target malicious users of spy software targeting Android users, known as <e1>DroidJack</e1>.

With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan\u2019s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan\u2019s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan\u2019s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015\u20132016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format \u201c/[number]\u201d (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0\u20139999). In some samples, starting from January 2016, an algorithm has been implemented for unpacking the encrypted executable DEX file from the assets folder.

Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them.

As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 <e1>hellowopung[.]com</e1> 102 5 quostpeopls[.", "0 In April 2019, researchers uncovered \u2018<e1>XLoader</e1> version 7.0\u2019 that poses as a pornography app for <e2>Android</e2> devices.", "According to public records it appears that eSurv began to also develop intrusion software in 2016. <e1>Exodus</e1> is equipped with extensive collection and interception capabilities.

Disguised Spyware Uploaded on Google Play Store We identified previously unknown spyware apps being successfully uploaded on Google Play Store multiple times over the course of over two years. These apps would remain available on the Play Store for months and would eventually be re-uploaded. While details would vary, all of the identified copies of this spyware shared a similar disguise. In most cases they would be crafted to appear as applications distributed by unspecified mobile operators in Italy. Often the app description on the Play Store would reference some SMS messages the targets would supposedly receive leading them to the Play Store page. All of the Play Store pages we identified and all of the decoys of the apps themselves are written in Italian. According to Google, whom we have contacted to alert about our discoveries, nearly 25 variants of this spyware were uploaded on Google Play Store. Google Play has removed the apps and they stated that \"thanks to enhanced detection models, Google Play Protect will now be able to better detect future variants of these applications\". While Google did not share with us the total number of infected devices, they confirmed that one of these malicious apps collected over 350 installations through the Play Store, while other variants collected few dozens each, and that all infections were located in <e2>Italy</e2>.

Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or Game644.res). In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights. But the malicious ip file does not contain any methods from the original ip file.

Kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation. Since TrickMo\u2019s HTTP traffic with its C&C server is not encrypted, it can easily be tampered with. In the following image, we can see the function that parses the commands from the C&C server. If the returned JSON object has the \u201c4\u201d key, it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service, all without the victim ever noticing anything. The kill switch can also be turned on by SMS. This is a bit more complicated since the SMS commands are encrypted and encoded with base64. The encryption algorithm used is RSA, and interestingly, the authors chose to use the private key for decryption and leave it in the code as a hardcoded string. The image below shows the function that parses the SMS messages, decrypts them using the hardcoded RSA private key and executes the commands. Having analyzed a few variants of the malware, we noticed that the private key was exposed in the code and did not change. Therefore, our team managed to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that activated the kill switch. This means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an SMS message. Our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the HTTP traffic from the C&C or by sending crafted SMS messages. Suspect You\u2019re Infected?

Conclusion The \u201cCorona Updates\u201d app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app\u2019s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a \u201cright time\u201d to inject the malicious codes. It\u2019s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and \u201cincubation.\u201d As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments.

To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to \"trick\" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen Signal data. The data stolen from the Signal app is as follows: Images transferred using Signal (these are unencrypted on the phone) A copy of the messages, stored in an SQLite3 database (these are encrypted on the phone) The messages require a key from the phones keychain in order to be successfully decrypted. In the Volexity test environment, the required key was not automatically exfiltrated, perhaps showing a shortcoming in the attackers' thinking. Over time, the IP addresses the malware was configured to communicate with, ports, and certificates used to verify the server were modified.

However, although the \u201cConcipit1248\u201d app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the \u201cConcipit1248\u201d app is still incubating. The other iOS app \u201cConcipit Shop\u201d from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The \u201cCorona Updates\u201d app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app\u2019s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a \u201cright time\u201d to inject the malicious codes. It\u2019s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and \u201cincubation.\u201d As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app\u2019s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

An Era of Mobile Malware Downloaders As app store operators layer security to stymie the efforts of malicious developers, black-hat app distributors find ways to sidestep them. To circumvent ever-evolving app store defenses, mobile malware distributors rely on a strategy from the PC malware realms: Instead of uploading the actual malware to the store, which can result in sampling and detection at a very early stage in the distribution chain, they upload a downloader that may seem rather innocuous compared to actual malware. In general, a downloader app is more likely to survive security checks and recurring scans, and once it lands on a user\u2019s device, it can fetch the intended malware app. As the Chinese general Sun Tzu wrote in \u201cThe Art of War,\u201d \u201cThe greatest victory is that which requires no battle.\u201d Sample Downloader Campaign From Current Analyses In the current campaign, according to X-Force researchers, the downloader apps target <e2>Turkish</e2>-speaking users.", "This new version includes various enhancements, so we have dubbed it <e1>RuMMS v2.0</e1>.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C.

Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple\u2019s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple\u2019s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise\u2019s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to \u201ckeep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators\u201d. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered. In particular, these packages have not been observed to contain or to download exploits which would be required to perform certain types of activities on iOS devices. Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user\u2019s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically. Upload data was queued and transmitted via HTTP PUT requests to an endpoint on the C2. The iOS apps leverage the same C2 infrastructure as the Android version and use similar communications protocols. Push notifications were also used to control audio recording. Lookout has shared information about this family with Apple, and they have revoked the affected certificates. As a result, no new instances of this app can be installed on iOS devices and existing installations can no longer be run. Lookout customers are also protected from this threat on both Android and <e2>iOS</e2>.", "The developer behind <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> also claims the Trojan can target multiple payment systems, retail applications and social media apps such as PayPal, Airbnb, Amazon, eBay, WhatsApp, Viber, Skype, <e2>Uber</e2> and more.", "In the course of researching the <e1>Pegasus</e1> for <e2>iOS</e2>, Lookout discovered three vulnerabilities Pegasus used to jailbreak the target device, and install and run the malicious software.", "In this latest iteration of <e1>Anubis</e1> code, the basic banking trojan has added a credential stealer to the mix, Lookout pointed out, meaning that logins for cloud-based platforms like Microsoft 365 are also at risk of compromise.

With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan\u2019s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan\u2019s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan\u2019s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015\u20132016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format \u201c/[number]\u201d (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0\u20139999).

The app, named Dardesh, posed as a chat application and acted as a downloader for a second app that could spy on users. The Dardesh app was spotted and analyzed by Lookout researchers, who dubbed the malware family Desert Scorpion. How was the app delivered to targets? The malicious Dardesh chat app was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play. Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic \u201csettings\u201d application, which is capable of tracking the device\u2019s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more. \u201cThe surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application,\u201d the researchers pointed out. Google removed the app from Google Play earlier this month and took action on it via the Play Protect security suite, which can warn users about malicious apps or even remove them from devices. Who\u2019s behind the attack? Lookout researchers believe a threat group dubbed APT-C-23 to be behind this scheme. \u201cOur current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers,\u201d they noted. The Facebook profile that posted a link to it is the same one that previously posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-23. Also, the C&C infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, which supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating both families. \u201cThe approach of separating malicious functionality out into separate stages that are later downloaded during execution and not present in the initial app published to the Google Play Store, combined with social engineering delivered via social media platforms like Facebook, requires minimal investment in comparison to premium tooling like <e1>Pegasus</e1> or FinFisher,\u201d the researchers pointed out.", "\u201cBecause these anomalous iCloud connections occurred\u2014and ceased\u2014immediately prior to <e1>Pegasus</e1> installation\u2026we believe they represent the initial vector by which <e2>Tamer Almisshal</e2>\u2019s phone was hacked,\u201d researchers said.", "There are the following relevant detection paths (the last one is an alternative <e2>Telegram</e2> client \u2013 \u201cTelegram X\u201c): This would be a very unusual coincidence. Even when a false flag might also be a possibility, we consider this to be unlikely. The samples sharing this overlap are modified versions of an open source Jabber/XMPP client called \u201cConversations\u201d with some code additions. The legitimate version of this app is also available on Google Play. The Conversations modified samples differ from the original one in the getKnownHosts method that was modified to replace the main XMPP host with the attackers\u2019 C2 server: It appears that the attackers were using a specific C2 for the use of that app. Another important modification is in the message transfer process: With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message. There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications.

A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that\u2019s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won\u2019t be able to continue to use their bank\u2019s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone\u2019s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access.

This allows the application to appear legitimate, especially given these applications icons and user interface. FAKESPY CODE ANALYSIS Once the user clicks on the malicious link from the SMS message, the app asks them to approve installation from unknown resources. This configuration can be toggled on by going to \u2018Settings\u2019 -> \u2018Security\u2019 -> \u2018Unknown Resources\u2019. PackageInstaller shows the app\u2019s permission access and asks for the user's approval, which then installs the application. This analysis dissects FakeSpy\u2019s Chunghwa Post app version, which emerged in April 2020. During the installation, the malware asks for the following permissions: READ_PHONE_STATE - Allows read-only access to the phone state, including the current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any PhoneAccounts registered on the device. READ_SMS - Allows the application to read text messages. RECEIVE_SMS - Allows the application to receive SMS messages. WRITE_SMS - Allows the application to write to SMS messages stored on the device or SIM card, including y deleting messages. SEND_SMS - Allows the application to send SMS messages. INTERNET - Allows the application to open network sockets. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to write to external storage. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to read from external storage. RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - Allows the application to receive a broadcast after the system finishes booting. GET_TASKS - Allows the application to get information about current or recently run tasks. (deprecated in API level 21) SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW - Allows the application to create windows shown on top of all other apps. WAKE_LOCK - Allows the application to use PowerManager WakeLocks to keep the processor from sleeping or the screen from dimming. ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - Allows the application to access information about networks. REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS - Whitelists the application to allow it to ignore battery optimizations. READ_CONTACTS - Allows the application to read the user's contacts data. On opening the app, two pop-up messages appear on screen: Change SMS App: This sets permissions to intercept every SMS received on the device and send a copy of these messages to the C2 server. Ignore Battery Optimization: This sets permissions to continue to operate at full capacity while the phone's screen is turned off and the phone locked. These requests rely on the end user accepting the permission changes and points to the importance of healthy skepticism when giving applications permissions.

Conclusion The \u201cCorona Updates\u201d app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app\u2019s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a \u201cright time\u201d to inject the malicious codes. It\u2019s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and \u201cincubation.\u201d As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app\u2019s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading.

A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that\u2019s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won\u2019t be able to continue to use their bank\u2019s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone\u2019s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK BRAND].

Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple\u2019s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple\u2019s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise\u2019s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to \u201ckeep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators\u201d. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered. In particular, these packages have not been observed to contain or to download exploits which would be required to perform certain types of activities on iOS devices. Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user\u2019s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically. Upload data was queued and transmitted via HTTP PUT requests to an endpoint on the C2. The <e2>iOS</e2> apps leverage the same C2 infrastructure as the Android version and use similar communications protocols.", "According to the researchers from Kaspersky, a hacker group has been found targeting Israel citizens and other Middle East countries with surveillance malware named <e1>Triout</e1>. The malware is designed to steal sensitive information, including call recordings, text messages, photos, videos, and location data without users\u2019 knowledge. Apart from spying features, the malware also has backdoor capabilities, including upload, download, delete files, record surrounding audio, takeover camera, and make calls or send messages to specific numbers, according to the researchers. The researchers said that attackers used Smali injection technique, that allows hackers to disassemble the code of an original application and add malicious code. \u201cIn May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to Israeli citizens. Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we investigated the file, we quickly found out that the inner workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information,\u201d Kaspersky said in a statement.

Kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation. Since TrickMo\u2019s HTTP traffic with its C&C server is not encrypted, it can easily be tampered with. In the following image, we can see the function that parses the commands from the C&C server. If the returned JSON object has the \u201c4\u201d key, it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service, all without the victim ever noticing anything. The kill switch can also be turned on by SMS. This is a bit more complicated since the SMS commands are encrypted and encoded with base64. The encryption algorithm used is RSA, and interestingly, the authors chose to use the private key for decryption and leave it in the code as a hardcoded string. The image below shows the function that parses the SMS messages, decrypts them using the hardcoded RSA private key and executes the commands. Having analyzed a few variants of the malware, we noticed that the private key was exposed in the code and did not change. Therefore, our team managed to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that activated the kill switch. This means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an SMS message. Our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the HTTP traffic from the C&C or by sending crafted SMS messages. Suspect You\u2019re Infected?

However, although the \u201cConcipit1248\u201d app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever.

Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The \u201cCorona Updates\u201d app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app\u2019s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a \u201cright time\u201d to inject the malicious codes. It\u2019s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and \u201cincubation.\u201d As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app\u2019s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command \"40\" and the names of apps. We noticed that command \"40\" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device.

If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose. Starting content observers and the main task loop to receive remote commands and exfiltrate data The app uses six techniques to collect user data: Repeated commands: use alarms to periodically repeat actions on the device to expose data, including gathering location data. Data collectors: dump all existing content on the device into a queue. Data collectors are used in conjunction with repeated commands to collect user data including, SMS settings, SMS messages, Call logs, Browser History, Calendar, Contacts, Emails, and messages from selected messaging apps, including WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook, Kakoa, Viber, and Skype by making /data/data directories of the apps world readable. Content observers: use Android's ContentObserver framework to gather changes in SMS, Calendar, Contacts, Cell info, Email, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Kakao, Viber, and Skype.

Kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation. Since TrickMo\u2019s HTTP traffic with its C&C server is not encrypted, it can easily be tampered with. In the following image, we can see the function that parses the commands from the C&C server. If the returned JSON object has the \u201c4\u201d key, it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service, all without the victim ever noticing anything. The kill switch can also be turned on by SMS. This is a bit more complicated since the SMS commands are encrypted and encoded with base64. The encryption algorithm used is RSA, and interestingly, the authors chose to use the private key for decryption and leave it in the code as a hardcoded string. The image below shows the function that parses the SMS messages, decrypts them using the hardcoded RSA private key and executes the commands. Having analyzed a few variants of the malware, we noticed that the private key was exposed in the code and did not change. Therefore, our team managed to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that activated the kill switch. This means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an SMS message. Our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the HTTP traffic from the C&C or by sending crafted SMS messages. Suspect You\u2019re Infected?

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command \"40\" and the names of apps. We noticed that command \"40\" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php.

A <e2>Remote Access Trojan (RAT)</e2> is a type of malware that controls a system through a remote network connection. A RAT is typically installed without the victim's knowledge, often as payload of a trojan horse program, and will try to hide its operation from the victim and from security software and other anti-virus software. A RAT enables its operators to perform many activities on the compromised device (e.g. control a device's camera, access its storage, intercept calls and text messages, etc.). This is all done via an easy-to-use application hosted on a command and control server.

Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple\u2019s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple\u2019s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise\u2019s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L.

To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to \"trick\" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen Signal data. The data stolen from the <e2>Signal</e2> app is as follows: Images transferred using Signal (these are unencrypted on the phone) A copy of the messages, stored in an SQLite3 database (these are encrypted on the phone) The messages require a key from the phones keychain in order to be successfully decrypted.", "The spyware, called Pegasus and developed by the Israeli company NSO Group, is reportedly instrumental to several governments\u2019 oppressive surveillance campaigns against their own citizens and residents, and, while <e2>NSO Group</e2> has repeatedly denied allegations that it complicitly sells <e1>Pegasus</e1> to human right abusers, it is difficult to reconcile exactly how the zero-click spyware program\u2014which non-consensually and invisibly steals emails, text messages, photos, videos, locations, passwords, and social media activity\u2014is at the same time a tool that can, in its very use, respect the rights of those around the world to speak freely, associate safely, and live privately.", "One of the new <e1>HummingWhale</e1> apps came to the attention of Check Point after it noticed a familiar piece of code that appeared in not one, but a dozen different apps, which indicated that malware was installed within them.

However, although the \u201cConcipit1248\u201d app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the \u201cConcipit1248\u201d app is still incubating. The other iOS app \u201cConcipit Shop\u201d from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The \u201cCorona Updates\u201d app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app\u2019s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a \u201cright time\u201d to inject the malicious codes. It\u2019s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and \u201cincubation.\u201d As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app\u2019s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading. Make sure that all other apps installed and the device operating systems are updated to the latest version.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command \"40\" and the names of apps. We noticed that command \"40\" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 <e1>glowbobget[.]com</e1> 45 4 hellowopung[.", "As anticipated, Monokle was developed by STC, the experts noticed that <e1>Monokle</e1> and the STC\u2019s Android security suite called <e2>Defender</e2> are digitally signed with the same digital certificates and have the same C&C infrastructure.", "After which, <e1>XLoader</e1> can steal device owners\u2019 personal information as well as download additional malware.

All of the victims are located in <e2>Italy</e2>. All of these Google Play Store pages have been taken down by Google.", "All the malicious <e1>Dvmap</e1> apps had the same functionality. They decrypt several archive files from the assets folder of the installation package, and launch an executable file from them with the name \u201cstart.\u201d The interesting thing is that the Trojan supports even the 64-bit version of Android, which is very rare. All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res \u2013 and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called \u201ccommon\u201d. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system. It will also install the malicious app \u201ccom.qualcmm.timeservices.\u201d These archives contain the file \u201c.root.sh\u201d which has some comments in Chinese: Main phase In this phase, the Trojan launches the \u201cstart\u201d file from Game324.res or Game644.res. It will check the version of Android installed and decide which library should be patched. For Android 4.4.4 and older, the Trojan will patch method _Z30dvmHeapSourceStartupBeforeForkv from libdvm.so, and for Android 5 and newer it will patch method nativeForkAndSpecialize from libandroid_runtime.so. Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory. After that, the Trojan will replace the original /system/bin/ip with a malicious one from the archive (Game324.res or Game644.res). In doing so, the Trojan can be sure that its malicious module will be executed with system rights. But the malicious ip file does not contain any methods from the original ip file. This means that all apps that were using this file will lose some functionality or even start crashing. Malicious module \u201cip\u201d This file will be executed by the patched system library. It can turn off \u201cVerifyApps\u201d and enable the installation of apps from 3rd party stores by changing system settings. Furthermore, it can grant the \u201ccom.qualcmm.timeservices\u201d app Device Administrator rights without any interaction with the user, just by running commands. It is a very unusual way to get Device Administrator rights. Malicious app com.qualcmm.timeservices As I mentioned before, in the \u201cinitial phase\u201d, the Trojan will install the \u201ccom.qualcmm.timeservices\u201d app. Its main purpose is to download archives and execute the \u201cstart\u201d binary from them. During the investigation, this app was able to successfully connect to the command and control server, but it received no commands.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command \"40\" and the names of apps. We noticed that command \"40\" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern <e1>http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php.</e1> We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.", "Check Point saw Android phones infected with malicious software containing early <e1>Gooligan</e1> code when physically connected to PCs running a Windows back-up tool, <e2>SnapPea</e2>.

Also, when an SMS arrives, the Trojan puts the phone into silent mode and switches off the screen so the user doesn\u2019t notice that a new SMS has arrived. When required, the Trojan sends an SMS to the specified phone number with the information it has received from the intercepted message.\u201d If it doesn\u2019t receive any instruction about rules to process the incoming Messages then it simply stores all the SMS in local DB and uploads it into the C&C server. Also, The Trojan displays a phishing page (bank.html) prompting the user to enter their bank card details. This page mimics a legitimate bank form and blocks the device screen until the user enters all the information. It even has its own virtual keyboard that supposedly protects the victim from keyloggers. This trojan force users to enter only right credentials and it checks all the details against the data that it already received. Once the victim entered all the data then it checks the originality of the data and uploaded into C&C server.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them.

The malicious Dardesh chat app was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play. Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic \u201csettings\u201d application, which is capable of tracking the device\u2019s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more. \u201cThe surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application,\u201d the researchers pointed out. Google removed the app from Google Play earlier this month and took action on it via the Play Protect security suite, which can warn users about malicious apps or even remove them from devices. Who\u2019s behind the attack?

Once the actor provides the credentials to set up the TeamViewer server connection, the Trojan uses the Accessibility privileges to access the TeamViewer application, logs in using the provided credentials, grant any additional permissions it requires to run and dismiss any warnings issued (if applicable).

Data Collection and Exfiltration As mentioned, mike.jar equips the spyware with extensive collection capabilities, including: Retrieve a list of installed applications. Record surroundings using the built-in microphone in 3gp format. Retrieve the browsing history and bookmarks from Chrome and SBrowser (the browser shipped with Samsung phones). Extract events from the Calendar app. Extract the calls log. Record phone calls audio in 3gp format. Take pictures with the embedded camera. Collect information on surrounding cellular towers (BTS). Extract the address book. Extract the contacts list from the Facebook app. Extract logs from Facebook Messenger conversations. Take a screenshot of any app in foreground. Extract information on pictures from the Gallery. Extract information from th GMail app. Dump data from the IMO messenger app. Extract call logs, contacts and messages from the Skype app. Retrieve all SMS messages. Extract messages and the encryption key from the Telegram app. Dump data from the Viber messenger app. Extract logs from WhatsApp. Retrieve media exchanged through WhatsApp. Extract the Wi-Fi network's password. Extract data from WeChat app. Extract current GPS coordinates of the phone. While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. Ports 6203 and 6204: Facebook extraction service. Port 6205: Gmail extraction service. Port 6206: Skype extraction service. Port 6207: Viber extraction service. Port 6208: IMO extraction service. Port 6209: Telegram extraction service. Port 6210: SBrowser extraction service. Port 6211: Calendar extraction service. Port 6212: Chrome extraction service. Local and Remote Shells In order to execute commands on the infected devices, as well as to provide a reverse shell to the Command & Control operators, Exodus Two immediately attempts to execute a payload it downloads with the name null. Once launched, null will first verify whether it is able to fork on the system and that there is no other instance of itself currently running by checking whether the local port number 6842 is available. This payload will then attempt to instantiate a remote reverse /system/bin/sh shell to the Command & Control ws.my-local-weather[.]com on port 22011. It is worth noticing that this remote reverse shell does not employ any transport cryptography. The traffic transits in clear and is therefore potentially exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks: At the same time, null will also bind a local shell on 0.0.0.0:6842. This local port is used by Exodus Two to execute various commands on the Android device, such as enabling or disabling certain services, or parsing app databases. However, binding a shell on all available interfaces will obviously make it accessible to anyone who is sharing at least a local network with an infected device. For example, if an infected device is connected to a public Wi-Fi network any other host will be able to obtain a terminal on the device without any form of authentication or verification by simply connecting to the port. If the mobile operator doesn't enforce proper client isolation, it is possible that the infected devices are also exposed to the rest of the cellular network. Obviously, this inevitably leaves the device open not only to further compromise but to data tampering as well. null is not the only payload opening a shell on the phone. The rootdaemon binary in fact offers several other possibilities to execute commands on the infected device just by connecting to TCP port 6200 and issuing one of the following commands. Sending the command sh to TCP port 6200 results in a full terminal being dropped: Sending the command cmd followed by a proper terminal command will execute it and print the output (in the example we use id which displays the identity of the system user running the issued commands): Indicators of Compromise <e2>Exodus</e2> One 011b6bcebd543d4eb227e840f04e188fb01f2335b0b81684b60e6b45388d3820 0f5f1409b1ebbee4aa837d20479732e11399d37f05b47b5359dc53a4001314e5 2055584625d24687bd027a63bc0b8faa7d1a854a535de74afba24840a52b1d2f 26fef238028ee4b5b8da631c77bfb44ada3d5db8129c45dea5df6a51c9ea5f55 33a9da16d096426c82f150e39fc4f9172677885cfeaedcff10c86414e88be802 34d000ee1e36efd10eb37e2b79d69249d5a85682a61390a89a1b9391c46bf2ba 4f6146956b50ae3a6e80a1c1f771dba848ba677064eb0e166df5804ac2766898 5db49122d866967295874ab2c1ce23a7cde50212ff044bbea1da9b49bb9bc149 70e2eea5609c6954c61f2e5e0a3aea832d0643df93d18d7d78b6f9444dcceef0 80810a8ec9624f317f832ac2e212dba033212258285344661e5da11b0d9f0b62 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 a37f5d2418c5f2f64d06ba28fe62edee1293a56158ddfa9f04020e316054363f db59407f72666526fca23d31e3b4c5df86f25eff178e17221219216c6975c63f e0acbb0d7e55fb67e550a6bf5cf5c499a9960eaf5f037b785f9004585202593b Exodus One Package Names com.", "Perhaps more information on <e2>XLoader</e2> will be known in the future.

The threat actors also lure users into downloading the infected apps through phishing campaigns after stealing contact information from infected devices. Once the user downloads the Android banking trojan, the app monitors the device status to find the optimal time to execute attacks. The app can hijack two-factor authentication codes and hide the OTP SMS messages from the device user. Another feature allows the banking malware to detect whether the device is in motion by tapping into the motion sensor. When a device appears to be motionless for a long time, the banking malware operators conclude that the smartphone is running in a sandbox and used by researchers. They, therefore, abstain from executing attacks on the infected device. Analysis of Anubis source code reveals that the banking malware tampers with administrative settings to view running tasks as well as create a backdoor through Virtual Network Computing (VNC). In addition to stealing banking credentials, these permissions also allow the app to record audio, gain access to the contact list for spamming, send SMS messages, and make phone calls.

A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that\u2019s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won\u2019t be able to continue to use their bank\u2019s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone\u2019s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command \"40\" and the names of apps. We noticed that command \"40\" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed.

Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple\u2019s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple\u2019s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise\u2019s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L.

All encrypted archives can be divided into two groups: the first comprises Game321.res, Game322.res, Game323.res and Game642.res \u2013 and these are used in the initial phase of infection, while the second group: Game324.res and Game644.res, are used in the main phase. nitial phase During this phase, the Trojan tries to gain root rights on the device and to install some modules. All archives from this phase contain the same files except for one called \u201ccommon\u201d. This is a local root exploit pack, and the Trojan uses 4 different exploit pack files, 3 for 32-bit systems and 1 for 64-bit-systems. If these files successfully gain root rights, the Trojan will install several tools into the system.

Both of these libraries are runtime libraries related to Dalvik and ART runtime environments. Before patching, the Trojan will backup the original library with a name bak_{original name}. During patching, the Trojan will overwrite the existing code with malicious code so that all it can do is execute /system/bin/ip. This could be very dangerous and cause some devices to crash following the overwrite. Then the Trojan will put the patched library back into the system directory.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64.

A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that\u2019s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only. Once infected by the Ursnif malware and upon attempting to access their online banking account, victims are advised, via web injection, that they won\u2019t be able to continue to use their bank\u2019s services without downloading a security app. To obtain that app, they are shown a QR code and instructed to scan it with their phone\u2019s camera. Looking into the QR code provided through the injection, we found a Base64 encoded string with the details. If users scan the QR code, they will open a web page on their smartphone and be sent to a fake Google Play page featuring a corresponding banking app logo of the banking brand the victim originally attempted to access. The campaign, in this case, included a number of domains that were most likely registered for that purpose and reported in other malicious activity in the past, such as hxxps://play.google.servlce.store/store/apps/details.php?id=it.[BANK BRAND].

To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to \"trick\" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device.

As soon as the link is clicked, the spyware lures the victim to click a button that leads to the dropping of the malicious APK. The content hosted on the URL is in Russian. You can view the translation in the screenshot below: The APK is from an unknown source and, since Android systems do not allow direct-install, leads the victim via simple clicks to enabling the \"Unknown Sources\" option to install the malicious app. Each step is shown below starting from left to right. Enabling AccessibilityService Once installation is complete, the app masks itself as a messaging app (see the icon below). Upon first use, the app redirects the victim to enable Android AccessibilityService. Once enabled, the app disappears from the home screen. If the victim does not enable AccessibilityService, the spyware will continuously appear on the screen (see the second screen in the above snapshot) to encourage the victim to enable the service. Once AccessibilityService is enabled, the spyware goes into action to make the SMS app the default messaging app. It does this by using the functionality of AccessibilityService to automatically choose \u201cYes\u201d when asked to confirm the app as the default messaging choice, as shown in the below screenshot. Users will not be able to see this message box because the choice is made for them. Communication Our investigation showed that once the initial setup is done, the malware starts sending details to a command-and-control (C&C) server. The C&C details were hardcoded. Requests and responses from the C&C were encoded using Base64. The screenshot below shows the decode values being sent and received: The above screenshot shows details of a victim's device being sent to a C&C. The C&C replied with command \"40\" and the names of apps. We noticed that command \"40\" was used for disabling the apps. In this instance, the list of apps to be disabled contained well-known antivirus (AV) apps, including: Trend Micro Dr. Web AhnLab Avira Sophos McAfee F-Secure The malware makes sure that all of these AVs, if present, remain inoperable. As soon as a victim tries to open one of these apps, the malware abruptly closes it. It behaved similarly with an app from a well-known Russian bank, Sber Bank. The malware did not allow any Sber Bank apps to open. SMS: Sending and stealing The spyware waits for commands from the C&C server and accordingly exhibits its functionality. As in the case below, we found that command number \"11\" was used for sending SMS messages to any desired number with the body of the SMS instructed by C&C Upon further analysis, we also found the spyware to be stealing SMS messages from the victim's device. This functionality could also be used to steal bank-related one-time-password codes and other relevant information. The screenshot below shows this functionality in action: Stealing Contacts The malware is also able to steal contacts from the victim's device. We believe this functionality is used to further spread the malware with a well-known technique called SMS-Phishing (or SMiShing). Calling The malware also has calling functionality. In the example below, the number to be called was sent from the C&C server in the encoded manner seen here. One of the more interesting things we noticed was the way the malware was being distributed. Every time we visited the link, we were presented with a new malicious app exhibiting the same behavior explained above but with different app name, different package name, and even signed with a different Android certificate. We also found that apps had different C&C servers with the pattern http://<domain-name>.com/<random-chars>/index.php. We noticed the below mentioned domain names in association with the C&C servers: Sr # Domain Name # of apps contacted 1 sisirplus[.]com 172 2 vietusprotus[.]com 50 3 glowbobget[.]com 45 4 hellowopung[.]com 102 5 quostpeopls[.]com 24 6 bannerincbest[.]com 102 7 campuphome[.]com 9 8 wewelowertick[.]com 3 9 bigslogous[.]com 25 10 <e1>zavannerweb[.]com</e1> 55 Conclusion A new and improved RuMMS is back in full force as RuMMS v2.", "A, respectively). <e1>Project Spy</e1> uses the ongoing coronavirus pandemic as a lure, posing as an app called Coronavirus Updates.

Each of the observed exploit sites and malware C2 servers are detailed in Appendix A below. Targeting Website Visitors The Evil Eye actor set up IRONSQUIRREL code to be loaded in a variety of different ways through malicious iframes across the various compromised websites. Volexity observed a total of six different hostnames being used to launch attacks between January and March 2020. While the first round of attacks were identified across several websites, future attacks were only observed in conjunction with the Uyghur Academy website. The attacks were largely loaded in fairly standard ways, such as via an iframe on a website's index, a modified JavaScript file used by the website, or nested iframes\u2014which was the case on the Uyghur Academy website. The code below has been on the main index of the Uyghur Academy website for several months.

Otherwise, the file is either deleted or emptied out when not in use. In the first observed example of this iOS exploit actvity, the following code was observed inside Jplayer.html. The most notable method of loading the code was via an iframe that was observed on the Chinese-language version of the Uighur Times website. The following code was observed. Here, the entire iframe has been obfuscated by using base64 encoding, which is a common method to embed images in the source of websites. However, it is far less common to see an iframe load content from a remote website; this may be used as an indicator of suspect activity.

Lookout notified Google of the potential threat shortly after it was discovered. Together, during the latter half of 2018, we worked to remove the apps from the Play store while it was being deployed in the wild. iOS development Analysis of these Android samples led to the discovery of infrastructure that contained several samples of an iOS port. So far, this software (along with the Android version) has been made available through phishing sites that imitated Italian and Turkmenistani mobile carriers. Deployment to users outside Apple\u2019s app store was made possible through abuse of Apple\u2019s enterprise provisioning system. The Apple Developer Enterprise program is intended to allow organizations to distribute proprietary, in-house apps to their employees without needing to use the iOS App Store. A business can obtain access to this program only provided they meet requirements set out by Apple. It is not common to use this program to distribute malware, although there have been past cases where malware authors have done so. Each of the phishing sites contained links to a distribution manifest, which contained metadata such as the application name, version, icon, and a URL for the IPA file. To be distributed outside the app store, an IPA package must contain a mobile provisioning profile with an enterprise\u2019s certificate. All these packages used provisioning profiles with distribution certificates associated with the company Connexxa S.R.L. The apps themselves pretended to be carrier assistance apps which instructed the user to \u201ckeep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators\u201d. The iOS variant is not as sophisticated as the Android version, and contained a subset of the functionality the Android releases offered. In particular, these packages have not been observed to contain or to download exploits which would be required to perform certain types of activities on iOS devices. Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user\u2019s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically. Upload data was queued and transmitted via HTTP PUT requests to an endpoint on the C2. The iOS apps leverage the same C2 infrastructure as the <e2>Android</e2> version and use similar communications protocols.", "Sending the command sh to TCP port 6200 results in a full terminal being dropped: Sending the command cmd followed by a proper terminal command will execute it and print the output (in the example we use id which displays the identity of the system user running the issued commands): Indicators of Compromise Exodus One 011b6bcebd543d4eb227e840f04e188fb01f2335b0b81684b60e6b45388d3820 0f5f1409b1ebbee4aa837d20479732e11399d37f05b47b5359dc53a4001314e5 2055584625d24687bd027a63bc0b8faa7d1a854a535de74afba24840a52b1d2f 26fef238028ee4b5b8da631c77bfb44ada3d5db8129c45dea5df6a51c9ea5f55 33a9da16d096426c82f150e39fc4f9172677885cfeaedcff10c86414e88be802 34d000ee1e36efd10eb37e2b79d69249d5a85682a61390a89a1b9391c46bf2ba 4f6146956b50ae3a6e80a1c1f771dba848ba677064eb0e166df5804ac2766898 5db49122d866967295874ab2c1ce23a7cde50212ff044bbea1da9b49bb9bc149 70e2eea5609c6954c61f2e5e0a3aea832d0643df93d18d7d78b6f9444dcceef0 80810a8ec9624f317f832ac2e212dba033212258285344661e5da11b0d9f0b62 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 a37f5d2418c5f2f64d06ba28fe62edee1293a56158ddfa9f04020e316054363f db59407f72666526fca23d31e3b4c5df86f25eff178e17221219216c6975c63f e0acbb0d7e55fb67e550a6bf5cf5c499a9960eaf5f037b785f9004585202593b <e2>Exodus</e2> One Package Names com.phonecarrier.linecheck rm.rf operatore.italia <e1>it.offertetelefonicheperte</e1> it.", "STEALING SENSITIVE INFORMATION <e2>FakeSpy</e2> has multiple built in information stealing capabilities.

This allows the application to appear legitimate, especially given these applications icons and user interface. FAKESPY CODE ANALYSIS Once the user clicks on the malicious link from the SMS message, the app asks them to approve installation from unknown resources. This configuration can be toggled on by going to \u2018Settings\u2019 -> \u2018Security\u2019 -> \u2018Unknown Resources\u2019. PackageInstaller shows the app\u2019s permission access and asks for the user's approval, which then installs the application. This analysis dissects FakeSpy\u2019s Chunghwa Post app version, which emerged in April 2020. During the installation, the malware asks for the following permissions: READ_PHONE_STATE - Allows read-only access to the phone state, including the current cellular network information, the status of any ongoing calls, and a list of any PhoneAccounts registered on the device. READ_SMS - Allows the application to read text messages. RECEIVE_SMS - Allows the application to receive SMS messages. WRITE_SMS - Allows the application to write to SMS messages stored on the device or SIM card, including y deleting messages. SEND_SMS - Allows the application to send SMS messages. INTERNET - Allows the application to open network sockets. WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to write to external storage. READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE - Allows the application to read from external storage. RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED - Allows the application to receive a broadcast after the system finishes booting. GET_TASKS - Allows the application to get information about current or recently run tasks. (deprecated in API level 21) SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW - Allows the application to create windows shown on top of all other apps. WAKE_LOCK - Allows the application to use PowerManager WakeLocks to keep the processor from sleeping or the screen from dimming. ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE - Allows the application to access information about networks. REQUEST_IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS - Whitelists the application to allow it to ignore battery optimizations. READ_CONTACTS - Allows the application to read the user's contacts data. On opening the app, two pop-up messages appear on screen: Change SMS App: This sets permissions to intercept every SMS received on the device and send a copy of these messages to the C2 server. Ignore Battery Optimization: This sets permissions to continue to operate at full capacity while the phone's screen is turned off and the phone locked. These requests rely on the end user accepting the permission changes and points to the importance of healthy skepticism when giving applications permissions. DYNAMIC LIBRARY LOADING Once the application has finished the installation process, the malware starts its real malicious activity. The malicious application da.hao.pao.bin (Chunghwa Post) loads a library file libmsy.so used to execute the packed mycode.jar file. The JAR file is the decrypted version of the file tong.luo, which is located in the assets folder. By comparing the sizes of the encrypted asset file tong.luo vs the decrypted JAR file mycode.jar, it is interesting to note that it is the same file (almost the same size). After libmsy.so decrypts the asset file tong.luo, it loads <e1>mycode.jar</e1> dynamically into FakeSpy\u2019s process, as is shown from the output of the \u201cadb logcat\u201d command.", "The new trojan, known as <e1>EventBot</e1>, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others.

Even without capabilities to exploit a device, the packages were able to exfiltrate the following types of data using documented APIs: Contacts Audio recordings Photos Videos GPS location Device information In addition, the packages offered a feature to perform remote audio recording. Though different versions of the app vary in structure, malicious code was initialized at application launch without the user\u2019s knowledge, and a number of timers were setup to gather and upload data periodically.

If the targeted device is not vulnerable to these exploits, then the app attempts to use a superuser binary pre-positioned at /system/csk to elevate privileges. After escalating privileges, the app immediately protects itself and starts to collect data, by: Installing itself on the /system partition to persist across factory resets Removing Samsung's system update app (com.sec.android.fotaclient) and disabling auto-updates to maintain persistence (sets Settings.System.SOFTWARE_UPDATE_AUTO_UPDATE to 0) Deleting WAP push messages and changing WAP message settings, possibly for anti-forensic purpose.

To allow the malware to communicate with Volexity's custom server implementation, it was necessary to \"trick\" the malware into trusting the server we had set up to act as the C2. Since Volexity did not have access to the private key of the certificate originally embedded in the malware, another solution had to be identified. The chosen solution was to edit the malware directly and to replace the embedded certificate with one that we created. This was done by overwriting the certificate in the binary and updating the mach_h section size header to match the length of the new certificate. Once safely replaced, the malware trusted the sandbox server and began communication. With the malware successfully communicating with the Volexity C2 server, we were able to inspect the data stolen from our dummy device. As per previous write-ups of this malware, the data transferred is not encrypted (except for the HTTPS), so we can easily look at the data stolen. Since this has already been done in depth in the Project Zero write-up, we will not go over it again here, with the exception of the stolen Signal data. The data stolen from the Signal app is as follows: Images transferred using Signal (these are unencrypted on the phone) A copy of the messages, stored in an SQLite3 database (these are encrypted on the phone) The messages require a key from the phones keychain in order to be successfully decrypted. In the Volexity test environment, the required key was not automatically exfiltrated, perhaps showing a shortcoming in the attackers' thinking. Over time, the IP addresses the malware was configured to communicate with, ports, and certificates used to verify the server were modified. Functionality & Targeted Applications As described in the Project Zero and CitizenLab posts, the malware contains a list of applications for which it will steal data automatically if they are installed. Since the last analysis, the following applications have been added to this list: Signal (org.whispersystems.signal) ProtonMail (ch.protonmail.protonmail) The inclusion of these apps suggests they are being more commonly used by the Uyghur community than before. In particular, the inclusion of Signal and ProtonMail may suggest that the Uyghurs are aware of potential monitoring of their communications and are attempting to use applications with strong security features to avoid this. It is also worth noting that this implant also targets the popular messaging app <e2>WeChat</e2>.

This includes six different exploit websites; five instances of the malware implant; three different C2 IP and port pair combination; and two unique C2 IP addresses. Each of the observed exploit sites and malware C2 servers are detailed in Appendix A below. Targeting Website Visitors The Evil Eye actor set up IRONSQUIRREL code to be loaded in a variety of different ways through malicious iframes across the various compromised websites. Volexity observed a total of six different hostnames being used to launch attacks between January and March 2020. While the first round of attacks were identified across several websites, future attacks were only observed in conjunction with the Uyghur Academy website. The attacks were largely loaded in fairly standard ways, such as via an iframe on a website's index, a modified JavaScript file used by the website, or nested iframes\u2014which was the case on the Uyghur Academy website.

However, although the \u201cConcipit1248\u201d app requested permissions to open the device camera and read photos, the code only can upload a self-contained PNG file to a remote sever. This may imply the \u201cConcipit1248\u201d app is still incubating. The other iOS app \u201cConcipit Shop\u201d from the same developer appeared normal and was last updated on November 2019. Apple has confirmed that the iOS apps are not functioning based on analysis of the codes, and stated that the sandbox is able to detect and block these malicious behaviors. Conclusion The \u201cCorona Updates\u201d app had relatively low downloads in Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Austria, Romania, Grenada, and Russia. Perhaps the app\u2019s false capabilities also fueled the low number of downloads. It also appears the apps may still be in development or incubation, maybe waiting for a \u201cright time\u201d to inject the malicious codes. It\u2019s also possible that the apps are being used to test other possible techniques. A possible indication for timing might be when the app reaches a specific number of downloads or infected devices. The coding style suggests that the cybercriminals behind this campaign are amateurs. The incomplete iOS codes used in this campaign may have been bought while other capabilities appear to have been added. This may also explain the timing in between the apps becoming fully functional and \u201cincubation.\u201d As this is a group we have not observed before, we will continue monitoring this campaign for further developments. Users are cautioned to research and check reviews before they download apps. Observe and look at the app\u2019s display and text, stated functions, reviews from other users, and requested permissions before downloading.

Kill switches are used by many malware authors to remove traces from a device after a successful operation. Since TrickMo\u2019s HTTP traffic with its C&C server is not encrypted, it can easily be tampered with. In the following image, we can see the function that parses the commands from the C&C server. If the returned JSON object has the \u201c4\u201d key, it will turn on the kill switch and initiate its own removal by sending an intent and seamlessly confirming the uninstall using the accessibility service, all without the victim ever noticing anything. The kill switch can also be turned on by SMS. This is a bit more complicated since the SMS commands are encrypted and encoded with base64. The encryption algorithm used is RSA, and interestingly, the authors chose to use the private key for decryption and leave it in the code as a hardcoded string. The image below shows the function that parses the SMS messages, decrypts them using the hardcoded RSA private key and executes the commands. Having analyzed a few variants of the malware, we noticed that the private key was exposed in the code and did not change. Therefore, our team managed to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that activated the kill switch. This means that the malware can be remotely eliminated by an SMS message. Our team was also able to test other commands in the lab either by tampering with the HTTP traffic from the C&C or by sending crafted SMS messages. Suspect You\u2019re Infected? The following SMS message can be used to kill the sample analyzed in this research and all other variants that use the same private key: HrLbpr3x/htAVnAgYepBuH2xmFDb68TYTt7FwGn0ddGlQJv/hqsctL57ocFU0Oz3L+uhLcOGG7GVBAfHKL1TBQ== Sending this SMS will trigger TrickMo\u2019s kill switch by sending the string \u201c4\u201d encrypted with the generated RSA public key and base64 encoded.

While some of these acquisition are performed purely through code in mike.jar, some others that require access to, for example, SQLite databases or other files in the application's storage are performed through rootdaemon instead, which should be running with root privileges. In order to achieve this, mike.jar connects to rootdaemon through various TCP ports that the daemon binds on some extraction routines for supported applications: Port 6202: WhatsApp extraction service. Ports 6203 and 6204: Facebook extraction service. Port 6205: Gmail extraction service. Port 6206: Skype extraction service. Port 6207: Viber extraction service. Port 6208: IMO extraction service. Port 6209: Telegram extraction service. Port 6210: SBrowser extraction service. Port 6211: Calendar extraction service. Port 6212: Chrome extraction service. Local and Remote Shells In order to execute commands on the infected devices, as well as to provide a reverse shell to the Command & Control operators, Exodus Two immediately attempts to execute a payload it downloads with the name null. Once launched, null will first verify whether it is able to fork on the system and that there is no other instance of itself currently running by checking whether the local port number 6842 is available. This payload will then attempt to instantiate a remote reverse /system/bin/sh shell to the Command & Control ws.my-local-weather[.]com on port 22011. It is worth noticing that this remote reverse shell does not employ any transport cryptography. The traffic transits in clear and is therefore potentially exposed to man-in-the-middle attacks: At the same time, null will also bind a local shell on 0.0.0.0:6842. This local port is used by Exodus Two to execute various commands on the Android device, such as enabling or disabling certain services, or parsing app databases. However, binding a shell on all available interfaces will obviously make it accessible to anyone who is sharing at least a local network with an infected device. For example, if an infected device is connected to a public Wi-Fi network any other host will be able to obtain a terminal on the device without any form of authentication or verification by simply connecting to the port. If the mobile operator doesn't enforce proper client isolation, it is possible that the infected devices are also exposed to the rest of the cellular network. Obviously, this inevitably leaves the device open not only to further compromise but to data tampering as well. null is not the only payload opening a shell on the phone. The rootdaemon binary in fact offers several other possibilities to execute commands on the infected device just by connecting to TCP port 6200 and issuing one of the following commands. Sending the command sh to TCP port 6200 results in a full terminal being dropped: Sending the command cmd followed by a proper terminal command will execute it and print the output (in the example we use id which displays the identity of the system user running the issued commands): Indicators of Compromise Exodus One 011b6bcebd543d4eb227e840f04e188fb01f2335b0b81684b60e6b45388d3820 0f5f1409b1ebbee4aa837d20479732e11399d37f05b47b5359dc53a4001314e5 2055584625d24687bd027a63bc0b8faa7d1a854a535de74afba24840a52b1d2f 26fef238028ee4b5b8da631c77bfb44ada3d5db8129c45dea5df6a51c9ea5f55 33a9da16d096426c82f150e39fc4f9172677885cfeaedcff10c86414e88be802 34d000ee1e36efd10eb37e2b79d69249d5a85682a61390a89a1b9391c46bf2ba 4f6146956b50ae3a6e80a1c1f771dba848ba677064eb0e166df5804ac2766898 5db49122d866967295874ab2c1ce23a7cde50212ff044bbea1da9b49bb9bc149 70e2eea5609c6954c61f2e5e0a3aea832d0643df93d18d7d78b6f9444dcceef0 80810a8ec9624f317f832ac2e212dba033212258285344661e5da11b0d9f0b62 8453ce501fee1ca8a321f16b09969c517f92a24b058ac5b54549eabd58bf1884 a37f5d2418c5f2f64d06ba28fe62edee1293a56158ddfa9f04020e316054363f db59407f72666526fca23d31e3b4c5df86f25eff178e17221219216c6975c63f e0acbb0d7e55fb67e550a6bf5cf5c499a9960eaf5f037b785f9004585202593b <e2>Exodus</e2> One Package Names com.", "<e1>Triout</e1> - Spyware Framework for <e2>Android</e2> with Extensive Surveillance Capabilities No operating system is safe from malware, as cyber criminals will always want to steal, spy or tamper with your data.", "\u201cBased on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of <e1>Monokle</e1>: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the <e2>Ahrar al-Sham</e2> militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called \u2018UzbekChat\u2019 referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.", "Dubbed <e1>Red Alert 2.0</e1> (Detected by Trend Micro as ANDROIDOS_BANKER) by its creators, this new malware tricks users into downloading it by hiding in third-party app stores as fake versions of legitimate applications such as WhatsApp, Viber, and updates for both <e2>Android</e2> and Flash Player.", "By \u201call\u201d we mean all security mechanisms guarding the official Android app store (including the detection engines of the members of the App Defense Alliance) and all security vendors participating in the VirusTotal program (see Figure 1). <e1>DEFENSOR ID</e1> was released on Feb 3, 2020 and last updated to v1.4 on May 6, 2020.

It has been active for around one month. This malicious app, detected by ESET as a variant of Android/Twitoor.A, can\u2019t be found on any official Android app store \u2013 it probably spreads by SMS or via malicious URLs. It impersonates a porn player app or MMS application but without having their functionality. After launching, it hides its presence on the system and checks the defined Twitter account at regular intervals for commands. Based on received commands, it can either download malicious apps or switch the C&C Twitter account to another one. \u201cUsing Twitter instead of command-and-control (C&C) servers is pretty innovative for an Android botnet,\u201d says Luk\u00e1\u0161 \u0160tefanko, the ESET malware researcher who discovered the malicious app. Malware that enslaves devices to form botnets needs to be able to receive updated instructions. That communication is an Achilles heel for any botnet \u2013 it may raise suspicion and, cutting the bots off is always lethal to the botnet\u2019s functioning. Additionally, should the command-and-control (C&C) servers get seized by the authorities, it would ultimately lead to disclosing information about the entire botnet. To make the Twitoor botnet\u2019s communication more resilient, botnet designers took various steps like encrypting their messages, using complex topologies of the C&C network \u2013 or using innovative means for communication, among them the use of social networks. \u201cThese communication channels are hard to discover and even harder to block entirely. On the other hand, it\u2019s extremely easy for the crooks to re-direct communications to another freshly created account,\u201d explains \u0160tefanko. In the Windows space, Twitter, founded in 2006, was first used to control botnets as early as in 2009. Android bots have also already been found being controlled via other non-traditional means \u2013 blogs or some of the many cloud messaging systems like Google\u2019s or Baidu\u2019s \u2013 but <e2>Twitoor</e2> is the first Twitter-based bot malware, according to \u0160tefanko.", "The modern version of <e1>Rotexy</e1> combines the functions of a banking Trojan and <e2>ransomware</e2>.

His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. Marcher In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis. The actor behind the Marcher Trojan got banned and the renting service was discontinued. The renting model of that Trojan allowed purchase of the APK (bot) builder, therefore a number of Marcher actors obtained the source code of the admin panel and the bot itself. Some of them resold the sources and some of them used them as a base for their own banking malware; therefore, although operations were disrupted the Trojan remained active for a while and new malware families emerged. Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot Gustuff DiseaseBot Bubabot <e1>Neobot</e1> Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.

After Check Point notified Google about this threat, the apps were swiftly removed from the Play store. How Judy operates: To bypass Bouncer, Google Play\u2019s protection, the hackers create a seemingly benign bridgehead app, meant to establish connection to the victim\u2019s device, and insert it into the app store. Once a user downloads a malicious app, it silently registers receivers which establish a connection with the C&C server. The server replies with the actual malicious payload, which includes JavaScript code, a user-agent string and URLs controlled by the malware author. The malware opens the URLs using the user agent that imitates a PC browser in a hidden webpage and receives a redirection to another website. Once the targeted website is launched, the malware uses the JavaScript code to locate and click on banners from the Google ads infrastructure. Upon clicking the ads, the malware author receives payment from the website developer, which pays for the illegitimate clicks and traffic. The JavaScript code locates the targeted ads by searching for iframes which contain ads from Google ads infrastructure, as shown in the image below: The fraudulent clicks generate a large revenue for the perpetrators, especially since the malware reached a presumably wide spread.

In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps.

That's because most rudimentary malware apps don't get installed without an Android users actively lowering their own security settings in order to install apps outside of the supposedly protective wall of Google's app store. It's not unheard of for malware apps to sneak into the Android app store, but it is rare. An analysis of the Desert Scorpion app showed that its malicious functionality was not included in the app when submitted to Google Play, said Blaich. Rather, it was downloaded later when the user was interacting with the app. With ViperRAT, the malicious functionality within one of the apps looks almost indistinguishable from other social networking apps and obfuscated from view during the app store approval process. Andrew Blaich, Lookout's head of threat intelligence, said the Desert Scorpion app was installed more than a hundred times, while ViperRAT apps had about a thousand combined installs. What those may seem like a low numbers, Blaich said Desert Scorpion \"is a part of a targeted attack and not used for broad global-wide surveillance,\" and that \"this number is in line with what we would expect.\" After Lookout reached out, Google removed the apps from the app store. \"When we were notified by Lookout, we removed the apps from <e2>Play</e2> and updated Play Protect to help ensure users are secured,\" said a Google spokesperson.

Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, Asia and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and Australia.

The attacker behind the development of Anubis has been active for at least 12 years, and in order to stay current, has retooled the malware for use in fresh attack waves, Trend Micro researchers said on Monday. The Anubis banking Trojan is often found in social engineering and phishing campaigns, in which unwitting victims are lured to download malicious apps containing the malware. In total, 17,490 new samples of the malware have been found on two related servers by Trend Micro. Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt.

Such as, Ginp has traces of some of the codes of Anubis and the names of components of both the Trojans are also the same. The malware works by accessing the target device in the disguise of an authentic app. As soon as the malware gains access to the device, it hides the app icon and asks for Accessibility Service permissions. When the user grants permission, it automatically gets dynamic permissions. Using these permissions, the malware can send messages, make calls and perform overlay attacks easily without alerting the user. In June 2019, the Ginp malware appeared first on the Play Store as the Google Play Verificator app; initially, its main function was to steal SMS messages. However, by August 2019, another version of the malware appeared posing as the Adobe Flash Player app. This time, according to ThreatFabric\u2019s blog post, the malware could perform many other functions such as abusing Accessibility Service to become the default SMS app and performing overlay attacks. Later, two new versions of the malware surfaced that primarily targeted social media and banking apps. The current version is being distributed as legitimate banking apps mostly related to Spanish banks and some of the targets haven\u2019t ever seen before in any malware campaign.

Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt.

The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report.

Close-up of an icon on a smartphone screen Pegasus can infiltrate a smartphone via the widely used messaging app WhatsApp without the phone\u2019s user noticing. Christoph Scholz/Flickr, CC BY-SA Since 2019, Pegasus users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone\u2019s owner to know anything is amiss. Another way is by simply sending a message to a user\u2019s phone that produces no notification. This means the latest version of this spyware does not require the smartphone user to do anything.

Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background.

As of this writing, no files were hosted at any of the links. The threat actors seem to have abandoned these URLs and might be looking into other ways to reach more victims. Use of a shared hosting service to distribute malware is highly flexible and low cost for the threat actors. It is also much harder for network defenders or researchers to track a campaign where the infrastructure is a moving target. Many top providers in Russia offer cheap prices for their shared hosting services, and some even provide free 30-day trial periods. Threat actors can register subdomains through the hosting provider and use the provider\u2019s services for a short-period campaign. A few days later they can cancel the trial and do not need to pay a penny.

But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told The Post that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists.

Google has also revoked affected tokens and is using the Verify Apps on Android devices to block a list of Gooligan-infected apps, Ludwig said. While Gooligan doesn't directly harm end users, it comes at a price for legitimate Android developers who have a hard enough time being found among the two million apps now on Google Play. Google in October rolled out new detection and filtering in Google Play to combat fraudulently-installed apps and fake app reviews, which attempt to game Google's app-discovery algorithms. \"These attempts not only violate the Google Play Developer Policy, but also harm our community of developers by hindering their chances of being discovered or recommended through our systems. Ultimately, they put the end users at risk of making wrong decisions based on inaccurate, unauthentic information,\" Google said at the time. Like Ghost Push, the Gooligan malware affects pre-Android 6.0 Marshmallow devices. However, the new variant also lays bare the security risks foisted on end users by Android's dysfunctional patching system, which leaves large swathes of over one billion handsets exposed to old bugs. According to Check Point, Gooligan gains root on infected devices by exploiting Vroot and Towelroot, which have been known of since 2013 and 2014, respectively. \"Gooligan potentially affects devices on Android 4 Jelly Bean and KitKat, and 5 Lollipop, which is over 74 percent of in-market devices today.

Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be \"highly active\" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival <e2>Palestinian</e2> political party Fatah.

Names aside, the threat is clear: NSO Group has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals. Lookout enterprise and personal customers are protected from this threat. Finding the threat In the course of researching the iOS threat, Lookout researchers mined our comprehensive dataset and located signals of anomalous Android applications. We have sophisticated and valuable insight into what is happening in the mobile ecosystem at any given point in time. Without the Lookout <e2>Security Cloud</e2>, Pegasus for Android most likely would not have been found. [SEP]", "[CLS] Effectively, Anubis can be considered one of the most used Android banking Trojans since <e2>late 2017</e2>. As banking malware, Anubis operates by tricking its victims into providing personal and sensitive information such as online banking credentials, banking security codes and even credit card details. Many victims do not realise that the malware application does not pretend to be the bank, it mostly hides as a third-party app and therefore remains under the radar of the average user. Disguises used by Anubis where for example: fake mobile games, fake software updates, fake post/mail apps, fake flash-player apps, fake utility apps, fake browsers and even fake social-network and communication apps. The malware was rented privately to a limited number of \u201ccustomers\u201d; criminals willing to use such malware to perform fraud. At the moment of writing, the renting service is supposedly disrupted due to the author being under arrest or having simply vanished with customers\u2019 money, but the malware itself is alive and kicking. Through this blog post ThreatFabric experts revisit major stages of Anubis\u2019 evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor \u201cmaza-in\u201d wrote an article named \u201cAndroid BOT from scratch\u201d in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed <e1>\u201cAndroid.BankBot.149.origin\u201d</e1>. Although being a generic name for banking malware, \u201cBankBot\u201d became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. [SEP]", "[CLS] The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to <e2>APT-C-27</e2>. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families. What it does The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application. The chat application acts as a dropper for this second-stage payload app. At the time of writing Lookout has observed two updates to the <e1>Dardesh</e1> application, the first on February 26 and the second on March 28. [SEP]", "[CLS] Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the Apple App certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by <e2>DualToy</e2> on iOS devices has expired, researchers said. Palo Alto notes, during the past two years there have been similar cases of Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices via side-loading techniques. \u201cThis attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors\u2026 WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The HackingTeam\u2019s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,\u201d Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim\u2019s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple\u2019s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. \u201cThe app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like ZergHelper. It also has exactly the same behavior as <e1>AceDeceiver</e1>. When launched for the first time, the app will ask the user to input his or her Apple ID and password,\u201d Xiao wrote. [SEP]", "[CLS] \u201cIn May 2018, we discovered a campaign targeting dozens of mobile Android devices belonging to <e2>Israeli</e2> citizens. <e1>Kaspersky</e1> spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection.

The Evil Eye threat actor was observed launching an exploit aimed at installing a malware implant on Android phones. Volexity also believed this was likely the same group responsible for the launching exploits aimed at installing an iOS implant as described by Google's Project Zero. Immediately after the publications from Google and Volexity, the Evil Eye threat actor went fairly quiet. They removed their malicious code from compromised websites, command and control (C2) servers were taken down, and various hostnames stopped resolving. This largely remained the case until early January 2020, when Volexity observed a series of new activity across multiple previously compromised Uyghur websites. In the latest activity identified by Volexity, the Evil Eye threat actor used an open source framework called IRONSQUIRREL to launch their exploit chain. The exploits used targeted Apple iOS operating systems leveraging a vulnerability in <e2>WebKit</e2> that appears to have been patched in the summer of 2019. [SEP]", "[CLS] \u201d Sample Downloader Campaign From Current Analyses In the current campaign, according to <e2>X-Force</e2> researchers, the downloader apps target Turkish-speaking users. They differ in type and visual style \u2014 from online shopping to financial services and even an automotive app \u2014 and are designed to look legitimate and enticing to users. The variety of apps and styles indicates a large investment of resources on the part of the campaign\u2019s operators, suggesting that a cybercrime service, rather than a single cybercrime faction, is likely responsible. The downloaders themselves are rather stealthy, and VirusTotal missed all but one of the samples. The one that was found had zero detections by antivirus engines. In this campaign, the malicious downloader apps X-Force detected have the same code base as three apps that <e1>ThreatFabric</e1> reported in January 2018. [SEP]", "[CLS] Starting in June, our team discovered a number of new malware downloader samples that infect users with <e1>BankBot Anubis</e1> (aka Go_P00t). The campaign features at least 10 malicious downloaders disguised as various applications, all of which fetch mobile banking Trojans that run on Android-based devices. While the number of downloaders may seem modest, each of those apps can fetch more than 1,000 samples from the criminal\u2019s command-and-control (C&C) servers. Finding new downloaders in the app store in connection with the BankBot Anubis malware could suggest that: A given malware distributor/cybercrime faction has shifted from using Marcher to distributing BankBot Anubis; or The threat actors distributing the malware on Google Play are offering their \u201cexpertise\u201d as a service, spreading malware downloaders for different cybercrime factions that use mobile Trojans to facilitate financial fraud \u2014 aka \u201cdownloader-as-a-service.\u201d Such cybercrime services are common in the fraud and malware black markets. They entail a proven ability to infiltrate Google Play and plant malicious downloaders under the guise of benign-looking apps. These services can likely maintain the downloader\u2019s C&C servers long enough to generate a steady stream of new infections, suggesting the thought-out operational security and know-how characteristic of organized cybercrime groups. An Era of Mobile Malware Downloaders As app store operators layer security to stymie the efforts of malicious developers, black-hat app distributors find ways to sidestep them. To circumvent ever-evolving app store defenses, mobile malware distributors rely on a strategy from the PC malware realms: Instead of uploading the actual malware to the store, which can result in sampling and detection at a very early stage in the distribution chain, they upload a downloader that may seem rather innocuous compared to actual malware. In general, a downloader app is more likely to survive security checks and recurring scans, and once it lands on a user\u2019s device, it can fetch the intended malware app. As the <e2>Chinese</e2> general Sun Tzu wrote in \u201cThe Art of War,\u201d \u201cThe greatest victory is that which requires no battle.

Citizen Lab says ten of these 36 groups appear to be conducting surveillance in multiple countries and have not limited their spying inside their own country's borders, an act that may violate surveillance laws active in the states where Pegasus victims may be located. Citizen Lab researchers admitted that some of their findings may be inaccurate, as some targets may using VPN and satellite connections that may place their location in another country. But they also say this doesn't rule out that some Pegasus operators may be spying on dissidents living abroad, even in Western and well-developed countries where cross-border surveillance against their own citizens is strictly forbidden. In a statement provided to Citizen Lab researchers before the publication of today's report, an NSO Group spokesperson denied that the company was breaking any software export laws, adhering to the previously stated dogma that they're only selling Pegasus for crime-fighting purposes. \"Contrary to statements made by [Citizen Lab], our product is licensed to government and law enforcement agencies for the sole purpose of investigating and preventing crime and terror. Our business is conducted in strict compliance with applicable export control laws.\" To this statement, Citizen Lab responded with their own, pointing out that NSO Group, even after three years, continues to fail to see the reason the company is being heavily criticized online, and that's for selling Pegasus to oppressive regimes in the first place. \"Citizen Lab research does not speak to what statements <e1>NSO</e1> may make during marketing, sales, or export compliance.

These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user. If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely. After achieving root access, Gooligan downloads a new, malicious module from the C&C server and installs it on the infected device. This module injects code into running Google Play or GMS (Google Mobile Services) to mimic user behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection, a technique first seen with the mobile malware <e1>HummingBad</e1>. The module allows Gooligan to: Steal a user\u2019s Google email account and authentication token information Install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation Install adware to generate revenue Ad servers, which don\u2019t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not, send Gooligan the names of the apps to download from Google Play. [SEP]", "[CLS] The story repeats itself Looking at actual situation for Anubis, several scenarios are possible: Actors having access to relevant resources continue using <e1>Anubis</e1> in it\u2019s actual state Some actor or actor group will step in and will become the new maintainer of Anubis, business starts over Actors stop using Anubis and wait for some new banking malware to become available Actors having access to relevant resources will start to modify and improve the existing code base to create their own malware As mentioned before, Anubis itself is based on the Bankbot Trojan, which was made public on purpose. This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications. Target locations Based on the countries for which the targeted applications are made, it is possible to make statistics of the number of targets per region. As can be seen in following chart, it is clear that there is a strong interest in institutions providing services in Europe, Asia and the Americas: When we narrow this down to subregions we can see that the targets are in fact institutions active in Europe, West-Asia, North-America and <e2>Australia</e2>. Interestingly, those locations match banking malware\u2019s \u201cusual suspects\u201d; many of the previously observed banking malware families have been seen primarily targeting financial institutions in those subregions.

The BankBot Anubis malware then masquerades as an app called \u201cGoogle Protect\u201d and prompts the user to grant it accessibility rights. Why ask for accessibility? BankBot Anubis uses Android\u2019s Accessibility services to perform keylogging as a way to obtain the infected user\u2019s credentials when he or she accesses a targeted mobile banking app. In most Android banking Trojans, the malware launches a fake overlay screen when the user accesses a target app. The user then taps his or her account credentials into the fake overlay, which allows the malware to steal the data. BankBot Anubis streamlines this process. By keylogging the user\u2019s login information, the attacker can steal credentials from any app while avoiding the need to create custom overlays for each target.

The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play.

His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. Marcher In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis. The actor behind the Marcher Trojan got banned and the renting service was discontinued. The renting model of that Trojan allowed purchase of the APK (bot) builder, therefore a number of Marcher actors obtained the source code of the admin panel and the bot itself. Some of them resold the sources and some of them used them as a base for their own banking malware; therefore, although operations were disrupted the Trojan remained active for a while and new malware families emerged. Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot Gustuff <e1>DiseaseBot</e1> Bubabot Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.

A spokesman for NSO Group, Zamir Dahbash, said the mobile hacking software is only sold to governments. \"The agreements signed with the company's customers require that the company's products only be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes,\" the spokesman said in a statement. The spyware came to light after pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor received two text messages promising \"secrets\" about prisoners tortured in United Arab Emirates jails. Mansoor was almost immediately suspicious, he said. He has been jailed for his activism and targeted with commercial malware in past incidents that researchers have linked to the UAE government. \u201cI\u2019m a regular target for the authorities here,\u201d he told The Post. \u201cEvery time they get new spyware, they seem to try it out on me.\u201d So instead of clicking the links in the text messages, he sent them to researchers at Citizen Lab. Working with Lookout, they confirmed his fears: Mansoor\u2019s attackers would have been able to essentially take over his phone if he'd clicked. The UAE did not immediately respond to a Post request for comment. One brochure for the NSO Group advertises the malware used to target Mansoor, dubbed <e1>Pegasus</e1>, as a tool that allows \u201cremote and stealth monitoring and full data extraction from remote targets [sic] devices via untraceable commands.

Android mobile device users are being targeted in a new SMS phishing campaign that\u2019s spreading the FakeSpy infostealer. The malware, which is disguised as legitimate global postal-service apps, steals SMS messages, financial data and more from the victims\u2019 devices. The campaign was first discovered several weeks ago targeting South Korean and Japanese speakers, but it has now expanded that targeting to China, Taiwan, France, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom and the <e2>United States</e2>.

FakeSpy has been in the wild since 2017; this latest campaign indicates that it has become more powerful. Code improvements, new capabilities, anti-emulation techniques, and new, global targets all suggest that this malware is well-maintained by its authors and continues to evolve. INTRODUCTION For the past several weeks, Cybereason has been investigating a new version of Android malware dubbed FakeSpy, which was first identified in October 2017 and reported again in October 2018. A new campaign is up and running using newly improved, significantly more powerful malware as compared to previous versions. FakeSpy is under active development and is evolving rapidly; new versions are released every week with additional evasion techniques and capabilities. Our analysis shows that the threat actor behind the FakeSpy malware is a Chinese-speaking group, commonly referred to as \"Roaming Mantis\", a group that is known to have launched similar campaigns in the past. FakeSpy is an information stealer that exfiltrates and sends SMS messages, steals financial and application data, reads account information and contact lists, and more. The malware uses smishing, or SMS phishing, to infiltrate target devices, which is a technique that relies on social engineering. The attackers send fake text messages to lure the victims to click on a malicious link. The link directs them to a malicious web page, which prompts them to download an Android application package (APK). This most recent FakeSpy campaign appears to target users of <e2>postal services</e2> around the world. [SEP]", "[CLS] <e1>Ginp</e1> mobile Trojan fakes incoming SMS messages Having infiltrated a phone, most mobile banking Trojans try to gain access to SMS messages. They do so to intercept one-time confirmation codes from banks. Armed with such a code, the malware owners can make a payment or siphon off funds without the victim noticing. At the same time, many mobile Trojans use text messages to infect more devices by sending the victim\u2019s contacts a bad download link. Some malicious apps are more creative, using SMS access to distribute other things in your name, such as offensive text messages. The Ginp malware, which we first detected last fall, can even create incoming texts on the victim\u2019s phone that no one actually sent \u2014 and not only texts. But let\u2019s start from the beginning. What Ginp mobile Trojan is capable of? At first, Ginp had a fairly standard skill set for a banking Trojan. It sent all the victim\u2019s contacts to its creators, intercepted text messages, stole bank card data, and overlaid <e2>banking apps</e2> with phishing windows.

[SEP]", "[CLS] The so-called <e2>ViperRAT</e2> malware was incorporated into two apps, and it has previously targeted members of the Israeli Defense Force. Another app takes two malware types, called Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell, to spy on targets in Palestine. All three apps are linked to mobile-focused advanced persistent threats, said a new report published Monday by cybersecurity firm Lookout. In the case of the ViperRAT apps, built with a focus on social networking and chat, the apps, once installed, would profile the device and try to download a second-stage surveillance component. That downloaded component gave an attacker \"a considerable amount of control over a compromised device.\" The threat actor's motivations remain unclear. Lookout said there is \"currently no evidence\" the actor successfully deployed it against the Israeli Defense Force this time around, but did not name a new target. Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and <e1>FrozenCell</e1> suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer.

A similar 2017 campaign from the same \u201chighly active\u201d group, dubbed APT-C-23. The group has been linked to Hamas\u2019s political rivals as well as government employees, security services and university students. Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target\u2019s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target\u2019s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified <e1>Google</e1> on April 3.

Several technical details indicated that the software was likely the product of a well-funded development effort and aimed at the lawful intercept market. These included the use of certificate pinning and public key encryption for C2 communications, geo-restrictions imposed by the C2 when delivering the second stage, and the comprehensive and well implemented suite of surveillance features.

Those are tailored to different phones, screen sizes, languages and versions of Android. But when you click \"OK\" to accept the agreement, you're really granting it administrative privileges. Then Mandrake forwards all your text messages to the attackers, forwards phone calls to other numbers, blocks calls, installs or remove apps, steals contact lists, hides notifications, records screen activity, steals passwords to your Facebook and online bank accounts, creates phishing pages to leech your credentials for Gmail and Amazon, and tracks your location. The coup de gr\u00e2ce is a command built into the malware called \"seppuku,\" named after a form of Japanese ritual suicide. That command would factory-wipe the device, erasing all trace of the malware as well as all user data. Because you were tricked into granted Mandrake administrative privileges, rebooting the device or uninstalling the first-stage app won't get rid of the core malware. \"The only way to remove Mandrake is to boot the device in safe mode, remove the device administrator special permission and uninstall it manually,\" Bitdefender wrote. Because that's where the money is Advertisement Such sophisticated abilities, and such targeted attacks, are normally the sure signs of a state-controlled espionage operation. But the Bitdefender researchers think this was a purely criminal-controlled money grab, even if the operators do appear to be located in Russia.

In the course of further research, we found a number of related samples that point to a long-term development process. We believe the initial versions of this malware were created at least three years ago \u2013 at the end of 2014. Since then, the implant\u2019s functionality has been improving and remarkable new features implemented, such as the ability to record audio surroundings via the microphone when an infected device is in a specified location; the stealing of WhatsApp messages via Accessibility Services; and the ability to connect an infected device to Wi-Fi networks controlled by cybercriminals. We observed many web landing pages that mimic the sites of mobile operators and which are used to spread the Android implants. These domains have been registered by the attackers since 2015. According to our telemetry, that was the year the distribution campaign was at its most active. The activities continue: the most recently observed domain was registered on October 31, 2017.

There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications. In addition to adding the code, the attackers also changed the icon and package name. We do not know why, but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application. Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn\u00b4t discovered anything malicious in it.

The malware infected up to 600,000 Android devices per day during its peak. While details of the attack were released on Thursday, a major clean-up effort involving several Google teams, handset makers, hosting companies, ISPs, and research firms is already under way. Google has also revoked affected tokens and is using the Verify Apps on Android devices to block a list of Gooligan-infected apps, Ludwig said. While Gooligan doesn't directly harm end users, it comes at a price for legitimate Android developers who have a hard enough time being found among the two million apps now on Google Play. Google in October rolled out new detection and filtering in Google Play to combat fraudulently-installed apps and fake app reviews, which attempt to game Google's app-discovery algorithms. \"These attempts not only violate the Google Play Developer Policy, but also harm our community of developers by hindering their chances of being discovered or recommended through our systems. Ultimately, they put the end users at risk of making wrong decisions based on inaccurate, unauthentic information,\" Google said at the time. Like Ghost Push, the Gooligan malware affects pre-Android 6.0 Marshmallow devices. However, the new variant also lays bare the security risks foisted on end users by Android's dysfunctional patching system, which leaves large swathes of over one billion handsets exposed to old bugs. According to Check Point, Gooligan gains root on infected devices by exploiting Vroot and Towelroot, which have been known of since 2013 and 2014, respectively. \"Gooligan potentially affects devices on Android 4 Jelly Bean and KitKat, and 5 <e2>Lollipop</e2>, which is over 74 percent of in-market devices today.

Its victim is the banking apps inside your smartphone, but its functionality is much more complex. Like any Remote Access Trojan worth its salt, Cerberus is capable of deep surveillance within your device, interfering with the encrypted communications the phone has with its apps, and outside. Basically, Cerberus can intercept and steal your phone\u2019s unlock pattern or PIN, as well as Google Authenticator numbers, and any SMS necessary to perform a two-step verification. Likewise, this malware can interpose itself between you and your bank\u2019s app through an overlay, the most common method for carrying out a phishing attack. In short, Cerberus can enter your computer, extract all the necessary data to perform a bank fraud, and wait for the best moment to take the money from your account. All without you doing anything. Cerberus and its complex functionality Regarding what Cerberus can do, it is necessary to point out two possibilities within its functionality. We already mentioned that Cerberus is a RAT, but to achieve such control of the phone, it is necessary to have control of a vulnerability. In this case, it is the Android Accessibility Service.

The BankBot Anubis malware then masquerades as an app called \u201cGoogle Protect\u201d and prompts the user to grant it accessibility rights. Why ask for accessibility? BankBot Anubis uses Android\u2019s Accessibility services to perform keylogging as a way to obtain the infected user\u2019s credentials when he or she accesses a targeted mobile banking app. In most Android banking Trojans, the malware launches a fake overlay screen when the user accesses a target app. The user then taps his or her account credentials into the fake overlay, which allows the malware to steal the data. BankBot Anubis streamlines this process. By keylogging the user\u2019s login information, the attacker can steal credentials from any app while avoiding the need to create custom overlays for each target. This malware is also able to take screen captures of the user\u2019s screen, which it likely uses to steal credentials since the keyboard strokes are visible.

Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt.

Apple on Thursday issued security updates for OS X 10.10 Yosemite, OS X 10.11 El Capitan and Safari to address a vulnerability that potentially allows nefarious agents to take over a target device with a single click. Dubbed \"Pegasus,\" the assault package leverages three zero-day vulnerabilities to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device. One of the key tools in the process is an exploit that takes advantage of a memory corruption flaw in Safari WebKit.

Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play.

Is 2020 the year of smartphone malware? 2020 is the year of the rat, and we actually aren\u2019t talking about the Chinese horoscope. According to several cybersecurity researchers, 2020 has seen an explosive increase in Remote access Trojans, or \u201cRATs\u201d. This threat is not minor: a RAT can take control of your computer in the same way that a remote administrator would normally do, using tools such as TeamViewer or VNC. In this case, it\u2019s a malicious control: a RAT steals your personal information trying to carry out bank or identity fraud. However, and with the migration of PC users to the mobile world, hackers changed their strategy.

In the analysis that follows, we describe in detail the capabilities of this new variant and a \u201ckill switch\u201d that can remotely eliminate the malware from a mobile device. Why Do Desktop Trojans Use a Mobile Component? About a decade ago, attackers wielding banking Trojans could simply use stolen credentials to access a victim\u2019s online banking account and perform money transfers. As a countermeasure, financial institutions introduced various second factor authentication (2FA) methods. One method, which was popular in Germany, is known as mobile TAN (mTAN). It was implemented by sending an SMS message containing a one-time password (OTP) to the client\u2019s mobile device. The transaction would only be authorized after the client enters the TAN into the online banking website in their browser. Keep in mind that while this case is about TANs, it can be any OTP, depending on which bank is being targeted. Meanwhile, desktop banking Trojans developed the ability to execute various social engineering schemes by using web injections, a method that alters the content presented to the infected victim in their browser. In some cases, sophisticated web injects were used to trick victims into entering their 2FA codes directly into the web forms controlled by the malware to eliminate the need for the mobile malware component. But attackers were still constantly looking for new methods to steal TANs. Around 2011, the infamous Zeus Trojan started using web injects that tricked users into downloading a mobile component called \u201cZitMo\u201d (Zeus in the Mobile). This was used to bypass 2FA methods by intercepting the SMS messages coming from the bank and stealing the mTANs without the victim\u2019s knowledge.

The preface, Cerberus August 2020 marked the demise of Cerberus, the most successful Android banking Trojan service, or MaaS (Malware as a Service), of the last 12 months. Details about the Trojan can be found in our blog about from August last year. Apparently due to issues related to shortcomings of the staff within the threat actor\u2019s technical team, architectural and technical issues with the Trojan remained unsolved long enough for Google Play Protect to detect all related samples on the spot on all infected devices, of course resulting in unhappy customers. At the end of July, because of these issues, the actor behind Cerberus tried to sell the service, including the customer portfolio, in the hopes another actor would continue his work. Our telemetry, as seen in the graph below, shows a steady decrease of new Cerberus samples starting from this moment. After a series of customer complaints and due to his fruitless attempts to sell the source code of the Trojan as a whole, the owner of the malware finally decided to end the rental service and refund active license holders. On August 10th 2020 he shared the source code of Cerberus with the administrator of the underground forum in which he was renting it out. As we forecasted, shortly after, the source code of the Trojan became available to the general public. You might wonder why the number of samples drops and barely increases again despite the source code being publicly available. There are two reasons: firstly, actors who got their hands on the code need to understand how to setup the backend (C2) and builder, secondly the actors which successfully built samples noticed that their payload is immediately detected by <e2>Play Protect</e2> when installed on an Android device and therefore are now probably working on rearranging the code (resulting in their own code fork).

The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed \u201cAndroid.BankBot.149.origin\u201d.

A new campaign is up and running using newly improved, significantly more powerful malware as compared to previous versions. FakeSpy is under active development and is evolving rapidly; new versions are released every week with additional evasion techniques and capabilities. Our analysis shows that the threat actor behind the FakeSpy malware is a Chinese-speaking group, commonly referred to as \"Roaming Mantis\", a group that is known to have launched similar campaigns in the past. FakeSpy is an information stealer that exfiltrates and sends SMS messages, steals financial and application data, reads account information and contact lists, and more. The malware uses smishing, or SMS phishing, to infiltrate target devices, which is a technique that relies on social engineering. The attackers send fake text messages to lure the victims to click on a malicious link. The link directs them to a malicious web page, which prompts them to download an Android application package (APK). This most recent FakeSpy campaign appears to target users of postal services around the world. New versions of FakeSpy masquerade as government post office apps and transportation services apps. Our analysis indicates that the threat actors are no longer limiting their campaigns to East Asian countries, but are targeting additional countries around the world. THREAT ANALYSIS Infection Vector: Smishing Your Device Thus far, FakeSpy campaigns are characterized by SMS phishing (a.k.a. smishing). These SMS messages masquerade as a message from the local post office and link to the FakeSpy download.

There\u2019s another file, insapp.ini, which contains configurations including URLs to download iTunes drivers as well as iOS apps to install. Download and install iTunes After being loaded, the insapp.dll will check whether iTunes is installed on the infected computer. If not, it will download two MSI format installers from its C2 server.

APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt.

Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target\u2019s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app\u2019s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion\u2019s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the <e2>chat app</e2>, which is really just a \u201cdropper\u201d for malware pretending to be a settings application.

TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED Represents the event of changing the text of an EditText. Figure 6 shows one of the most noteworthy functions of Anubis: its ransomware module. The malware searches both internal and external storage and encrypts them using RC4. It adds the file extension .AnubisCrypt to each encrypted file and sends it to the C2. Anubis has been known to utilize Twitter or Telegram to retrieve the C2 address and this sample is no exception (Figure 7).

Usually, PHA authors attempt to install their harmful apps on as many devices as possible. However, a few PHA authors spend substantial effort, time, and money to create and install their harmful app on one or a very small number of devices. This is known as a targeted attack. In this blog post, we describe Chrysaor, a newly discovered family of spyware that was used in a targeted attack on a small number of Android devices, and how investigations like this help Google protect Android users from a variety of threats. What is Chrysaor? Chrysaor is spyware believed to be created by NSO Group Technologies, specializing in the creation and sale of software and infrastructure for targeted attacks. Chrysaor is believed to be related to the Pegasus spyware that was first identified on iOS and analyzed by Citizen Lab and Lookout. Late last year, after receiving a list of suspicious package names from Lookout, we discovered that a few dozen Android devices may have installed an application related to Pegasus, which we named Chrysaor. Although the applications were never available in Google Play, we immediately identified the scope of the problem by using Verify Apps.

The apps masqueraded as mobile carrier assistance apps that instructed users to \u201ckeep the app installed on your device and stay under Wi-Fi coverage to be contacted by one of our operators.\u201d The Apple-issued digital certificate used to distribute the malicious iOS apps was associated with an Italy-based company called Connexxa S.R.L.

[SEP]", "[CLS] Logs collected by Check Point researchers show that every day <e1>Gooligan</e1> installs at least 30,000 apps fraudulently on breached devices or over 2 million apps since the campaign began. How does Gooligan work? The infection begins when a user downloads and installs a Gooligan-infected app on a vulnerable Android device. Our research team has found infected apps on third-party app stores, but they could also be downloaded by Android users directly by tapping malicious links in phishing attack messages. After an infected app is installed, it sends data about the device to the campaign\u2019s Command and Control (C&C) server. Gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the C&C server that takes advantage of multiple Android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known VROOT (CVE-2013-6282) and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153). These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user. If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely. After achieving root access, Gooligan downloads a new, malicious module from the C&C server and installs it on the infected device. This module injects code into running Google Play or GMS (Google Mobile Services) to mimic user behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection, a technique first seen with the mobile malware HummingBad. The module allows Gooligan to: Steal a user\u2019s Google email account and authentication token information Install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation Install <e2>adware</e2> to generate revenue Ad servers, which don\u2019t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not, send Gooligan the names of the apps to download from Google Play.

Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers.

The BankBot Anubis malware then masquerades as an app called \u201cGoogle Protect\u201d and prompts the user to grant it accessibility rights. Why ask for accessibility? BankBot Anubis uses Android\u2019s Accessibility services to perform keylogging as a way to obtain the infected user\u2019s credentials when he or she accesses a targeted mobile banking app. In most Android banking Trojans, the malware launches a fake overlay screen when the user accesses a target app. The user then taps his or her account credentials into the fake overlay, which allows the malware to steal the data. BankBot Anubis streamlines this process. By keylogging the user\u2019s login information, the attacker can steal credentials from any app while avoiding the need to create custom overlays for each target. This malware is also able to take screen captures of the user\u2019s screen, which it likely uses to steal credentials since the keyboard strokes are visible. These features are staples of PC banking malware and are evolving in Android malware as well. The downloader apps in this particular campaign were designed to address Turkish users. With different botnets and configurations, BankBot Anubis itself also targets users in the following countries: Australia Austria Azerbaijan Belarus Brazil Canada China Czech Republic France Georgia Germany Hong Kong India Ireland Israel Japan Kazakhstan <e2>Luxembourg</e2> Morocco Netherlands New Zealand Oman Poland Russia Scotland Slovakia Spain Taiwan Turkey U.

The app\u2019s PackageInstaller showed its permission access and asks for the user\u2019s approval, which then installed the application. During installation, researchers observed FakeSpy gaining access to numerous permissions, including the ability to: read, write, send and receive SMS messages; open network sockets and access the internet; write to external storage; read from internal storage; and access information about networks to which the device is connected, among others. After installation, the app begins its \u201creal malicious activity\u201d by downloading a set of dynamic libraries from the libmsy.so file, which executes the packed mycode.jar file to load various insidious information-stealing capabilities into FakeSpy\u2019s process onto the device, Almkias said. Once FakeSpy is on the device, it steals all contacts in the device\u2019s contact list and their information, as well as the infected device\u2019s data. That includes the mobile number, the device model, the OS version, and banking and cryptocurrency app information.

Typically, the hackers design the ransom note so that it looks like a notice from a local police department. It informs the victims that they committed a crime and must pay a fine, after which it provides instruction on how to do so. In the past, cybercriminals created the ransom note by hacking the functionality behind the system alert window. The system alert window was always displayed in the foreground because it was designed to notify users about system alerts and errors. This made it ideal for the hackers\u2019 purpose.

Timeline of posts related to the Hacking Team DATE UPDATE July 5 The Italian company Hacking Team was hacked, with more than 400GB of confidential company data made available to the public. July 7 Three exploits \u2013 two for Flash Player and one for the Windows kernel\u2014were initially found in the information dump. One of these [CVE-2015-5119] was a Flash zero-day. The Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2015-2387) existed in the open type font manager module (ATMFD.dll) and can be exploited to bypass the sandbox mitigation mechanism. The Flash zero-day exploit (CVE-2015-5119) was added into the Angler Exploit Kit and Nuclear Exploit Pack. It was also used in limited attacks in Korea and Japan.

Previous multi-million leaks of Google accounts have proven false, most notably in 2014 when just two per cent of 5 million allegedly real logins leaked on the dark web turned out to work on active accounts, and in 2016 when only 460,000 of 23 million published online were deemed legitimate. Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers. Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year. The Chinese cybercriminals behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same. Ghost Push Gooligan is a variant of an old piece of malware known as Ghost Push that Google has been fighting in earnest for the last year. The initial warnings about Ghost Push landed in September last year, and Google said in April it was the most successful Android malware of 2015, infecting around 4 million phones in its various forms. It also rooted devices and displayed malicious ads. In October, security firm <e1>Cheetah Mobile Security</e1> said thredifferent versions of Ghost Push were propagating at a rate of 10,000 installs a day.

Identified firstly by Kaspersky\u2019s Android malware analyst Tatyana Shishkova in late October; Ginp is currently targeting users in the UK and Spain. Researchers opine that the Trojan was actually launched in June 2019 and is yet under the active development phase. According to researchers, cybercriminals have released at least five different versions of Ginp in the past five months, which reflects how eagerly cybercriminals are vying to improvise this Trojan. ThreatFabric analysts claim that Ginp is unique because its codebase was developed from scratch and is being expanded continuously through updates. Its target list is also considerably narrow as its main targets are the banks in Spain. The code of Gino has been copied from the code of another infamous Trojan called Anubis.

Anubis II is the Android banking Trojan created and advertised by an actor with the nickname \u201cmaza-in\u201d. This malware family goes beyond the well-known overlay attacks by combining advanced features such as screen streaming, remote file browsing, sound recording, keylogging and even a network proxy, making it an efficient banking malware but also a potential spying tool. Effectively, Anubis can be considered one of the most used Android <e2>banking Trojans</e2> since late 2017. [SEP]", "[CLS] Christoph Scholz/Flickr, CC BY-SA Since 2019, <e1>Pegasus</e1> users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone\u2019s owner to know anything is amiss. Another way is by simply sending a message to a user\u2019s phone that produces no notification. This means the latest version of this spyware does not require the smartphone user to do anything. All that is required for a successful spyware attack and installation is having a particular vulnerable app or operating system installed on the device. This is known as a zero-click exploit. Once installed, Pegasus can theoretically harvest any data from the device and transmit it back to the attacker. It can steal photos and videos, recordings, location records, communications, web searches, passwords, call logs and social media posts. It also has the capability to activate cameras and microphones for real-time surveillance without the permission or knowledge of the user. Who has been using Pegasus and why NSO Group says it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work. The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients. The earliest reported use of Pegasus was by the Mexican government in 2011 to track notorious drug baron Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. The tool was also reportedly used to track people close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It is unclear who or what types of people are being targeted and why. However, much of the recent reporting about Pegasus centers around a list of 50,000 phone numbers. The list has been attributed to NSO Group, but the list\u2019s origins are unclear. A statement from Amnesty International in <e2>Israel</e2> stated that the list contains phone numbers that were marked as \u201cof interest\u201d to NSO\u2019s various clients, though it\u2019s not known if any of the phones associated with numbers have actually been tracked. [SEP]", "[CLS] He added that: \u201cThe disclosure on <e1>TangleBot</e1> was made in a recent security advisory made available to the Commission\u2019s New Media and Information Security Department by the Nigerian Computer Emergency Response Team (ngCERT). TangleBot Android malware is installed when an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious link disguised as COVID-19 vaccination appointment-related information in an SMS message or information about fake local power outages that are due to occur.\u201d Over the years, fraudsters have used different types of malware such as Pegasus, Medusa, etc. to infiltrate the devices of unsuspecting users to steal their personal information, undermine enterprises, and retrieve financial details. However, TangleBot is said to possess a more evasive and elusive nature. How TangleBot operates The TangleBot malware is distributed via a text message to mainly Android users. In order to gain access to the user\u2019s device, the fraudsters send messages that are familiar to the user and implore them to read more or find more detailed information by clicking a provided link. When users click the provided link, the TangleBot malware takes over the device, providing the fraudsters access to financial information, personal information, etc. Worthy of note is the malware\u2019s ability to use advanced behaviors and transmission capabilities. This means that it tries to send messages that will interest the targeted user. For example, coronavirus related information or bonanza or gifts. In addition, other things the malware can do in an infected device include Recording the audio, screen, or both, then streaming them to another device. Placing overlay screens on the device, to obscure apps and screens. Silently, calling contacts and blocking calls. Sending and receiving text messages. Deploying further device observation or espionage capabilities The Nature of TangleBot While other types of Malware are internet based, capitalizing on <e2>social media apps</e2> to lure users, TangleBot only operates as text messages.

The SpyNote RAT was found being discussed on several underground hacking forums by the researchers which, after analyzing turned out to be a bigger threat than expected. Upon scanning, it was discovered that SpyNote doesn\u2019t require root access in order to take full control of an infected device. Once a device is infected, it can start stealing personal and financial data, however, that\u2019s just a start; SpyNote has much more to do that includes installing new APKs and updating itself, copying files from device to computer, view all messages on the device, access the contact list, make and listen to your calls, record or listen to audio from the microphone of the device, collect Mac address from WI-FI, IMEI number and details about carrier, and track GPS location of the infected device. Simply put: the SpyNote RAT will control your device and users won\u2019t even know about it. The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card. The researchers also found SpyNote\u2019s sample scanned on VirusTotal. The Unit 42 also noted that SpyNot OmniRat and DroidJack. OmniRat was detected in 2015 targeting MAC, Windows or Andriod operating system while DroidJack RAT was found also found in fake Pok\u00e9mon Go apps on Android store. Here is a video presentation demonstrating how SpyNote RAT works: Currently, SpyNote is not present in Google Play Store but it\u2019s only a matter of time before it will begin bypassing the Google\u2019s Bouncer system.

Usually, PHA authors attempt to install their harmful apps on as many devices as possible. However, a few PHA authors spend substantial effort, time, and money to create and install their harmful app on one or a very small number of devices. This is known as a targeted attack. In this blog post, we describe Chrysaor, a newly discovered family of spyware that was used in a targeted attack on a small number of Android devices, and how investigations like this help Google protect Android users from a variety of threats. What is Chrysaor? Chrysaor is spyware believed to be created by NSO Group Technologies, specializing in the creation and sale of software and infrastructure for targeted attacks. Chrysaor is believed to be related to the Pegasus spyware that was first identified on iOS and analyzed by Citizen Lab and <e1>Lookout</e1>. Late last year, after receiving a list of suspicious package names from Lookout, we discovered that a few dozen Android devices may have installed an application related to Pegasus, which we named Chrysaor.

Cerberus being discontinued, its customers seem to be switching to Alien, which has become the prominent new MaaS for fraudsters. Looking at what we know now about what happened with Cerberus and Alien, we could speculate that Cerberus was on the decline as the developers behind the Trojan shifted away from the project with the original source in order to start their own. Interestingly enough, this speculation is corroborated by the fact that when the second version of Cerberus (v2) was released in <e2>May 2020</e2>, it did not introduce any major new features, except for the one to steal 2FA codes from Google\u2019s authenticator app. [SEP]", "[CLS] We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running <e2>Facebook</e2> profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by Frozen Cell and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families. What it does The surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application. The chat application acts as a dropper for this second-stage payload app. At the time of writing Lookout has observed two updates to the <e1>Dardesh</e1> application, the first on February 26 and the second on March 28.

More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple\u2019s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it\u2019s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target \u2014 no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal\u2019s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses \u2013 likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal\u2019s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. \u201cWhile some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,\u201d researchers noted.

Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications.

It's not unheard of for malware apps to sneak into the Android app store, but it is rare. An analysis of the Desert Scorpion app showed that its malicious functionality was not included in the app when submitted to Google Play, said Blaich.

The malware opens the URLs using the user agent that imitates a PC browser in a hidden webpage and receives a redirection to another website. Once the targeted website is launched, the malware uses the JavaScript code to locate and click on banners from the Google ads infrastructure. Upon clicking the ads, the malware author receives payment from the website developer, which pays for the illegitimate clicks and traffic.

Researchers say that\u2019s where they found a malware builder tool specifically designed to be used to create multiple versions of SpyNote Trojan. SpyNote has a wide range of backdoor features that include the ability to view all messages on a device, eavesdrop on phone calls, activate the phone\u2019s camera or microphone remotely or track the phone\u2019s GPS location. The APK (Android application package file) containing the remote access tool (RAT) SpyNote, gives an attacker complete access to a victim\u2019s phone. SpyNote is similar to other remote administration tools such as OmniRat and DroidJack. <e1>Droidjack</e1> made news earlier this month when researchers at Proofpoint found a rigged version of the massively popular game Pok\u00e9mon Go with the Trojan.

Victims\u2019 first encounter with the malware reportedly comes via an unsolicited text message that their Android smartphone receives. The txt message uses social engineering to dupe unsuspecting users into clicking on a link to a downloadable Android application. CSIS provided a (sanitised) version of a typical message to warn users what to look out for: \u201cYou have received a multimedia message from +[country code] [sender number] Follow the link http://www.mmsforyou[.]net/mms.apk to view the message\u201d Once the APK package is downloaded, potential victims are urged to grant the malicious app a wide range of permissions on their Android device: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Once installed, MazarBOT downloads a copy of Tor onto users\u2019 Android smartphones and uses it to connect anonymously to the net before sending a text message containing the victim\u2019s location to an Iranian mobile phone number. With the malware now in place, a number of actions can be performed, including allowing attackers to secretly monitor and control smartphones via a backdoor, send messages to premium-rate numbers, and intercept two-factor authentication codes sent by online banking apps and the like. In fact, with full access to the compromised Android smartphone, the opportunities for criminals to wreak havoc are significant \u2013 such as erasing infected phones or launching man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

[SEP]", "[CLS] Lookout notified <e2>Google</e2> of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by <e1>Frozen Cell</e1> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families.

Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, Citizen Lab brought Lookout in to further investigate Pegasus. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the iOS version of this threat. What we discovered was a serious mobile spyware operation that has since been reportedly used to target Mexican activists, according to The New York Times. Google calls this threat Chrysaor, the brother of Pegasus. For simplicity, we\u2019ll reference this as Pegasus for Android. Names aside, the threat is clear: NSO Group has sophisticated mobile spyware capabilities across a number of operating systems that are actively being used to target individuals. Lookout enterprise and personal customers are protected from this threat. Finding the threat In the course of researching the iOS threat, Lookout researchers mined our comprehensive dataset and located signals of anomalous Android applications. We have sophisticated and valuable insight into what is happening in the mobile ecosystem at any given point in time. Without the Lookout Security Cloud, Pegasus for Android most likely would not have been found. After looking into these signals, we determined that an Android version of Pegasus was running on phones in Israel, Georgia, Mexico, Turkey, the UAE, and others. What it does The Android version performs similar spying functionality as Pegasus for iOS, including: Keylogging Screenshot capture Live audio capture Remote control of the malware via SMS Messaging data exfiltration from common applications including WhatsApp, Skype, <e2>Facebook</e2>, Twitter, Viber, Kakao Browser history exfiltration Email exfiltration from Android\u2019s Native Email client Contacts and text message It self-destructs if the software feels its position is at risk.

Check Point today released a free tool to check for infection. In a blog post, it also provided a list of apps containing the malicious Gooligan code. Shaulov believes there's a good chance the community effort will lead to Gooligan's demise, though he wouldn't reveal the names of those he believed to be involved. \"Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to bring this operation to its end,\" he told me. \"I\u2019m not sure I can say exactly who it is but I can probably say who is involved.\" No user data theft, says Google It does not appear the hackers are actually using the account credentials to pilfer user data. Google's Android security chief, Adrian Ludwig, posted a blog about Gooligan today, saying the company had not seen any evidence of other fraudulent activity on the stolen accounts, outside of the promotion of apps. \"The motivation behind Ghost Push is to promote apps, not steal information, and that held true for this variant,\" said Ludwig. All affected users have been notified and had their account login tokens reset. They've also been provided with clear guidelines on how to login securely, Ludwig added. Apps associated with Ghost Push activity have been removed from Google Play too.

The malicious Dardesh chat app was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play. Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic \u201csettings\u201d application, which is capable of tracking the device\u2019s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more. \u201cThe surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application,\u201d the researchers pointed out.

The so-called Gooligan strain has infected as many as 1.3 million Android phones since August, completely prising the devices open and stealing the tokens users are given to verify they are authorized to access accounts. Its main aim, though, is not to pilfer all that juicy data in Gmail or Docs, but to force users into downloading apps as part of a huge advertising fraud scheme, making as much as $320,000 a month. And Gooligan is spreading at an alarming rate: since the start of this month, it's been racking up an average of 13,000 new infections every day, according to researchers from Check Point. The malicious software first gains a foothold on devices when users visit a website and download a third-party app. Michael Shaulov, head of mobile and cloud Security Check Point, said that might be a porn site, or a third-party app store, where visitors are encouraged to download software to get access to content. But once downloaded, Gooligan determines which Android phone it's infected and launches the appropriate exploits to \"root\" the device -- i.e. take complete control over it. To do that, the attackers have used long-known vulnerabilities, such as <e2>VROOT</e2> and Towelroot, on devices running Android 4 through 5, including Jelly Bean, KitKat and Lollipop. [SEP]", "[CLS] Researchers say they have observed 8,000 unique samples of the <e1>DualToy</e1> variant to date, and add they can\u2019t be sure how many mobile devices have been infected by the malware. Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the Apple App certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by DualToy on iOS devices has expired, researchers said. Palo Alto notes, during the past two years there have been similar cases of Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices via side-loading techniques. \u201cThis attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors\u2026 WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The HackingTeam\u2019s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,\u201d Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim\u2019s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple\u2019s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password.

Rather than use those tokens to steal information, Gooligan-infected devices are designed to go about fraudulently earning their operators ad revenue. Check Point estimates that two million apps have been installed this way over the past three months. These apps earn attackers money in two ways: each app install results in a payment to the attacker, while apps also earn revenue from ad services that pay to distribute ads through installed apps.

As banking malware, Anubis operates by tricking its victims into providing personal and sensitive information such as online banking credentials, banking security codes and even credit card details. Many victims do not realise that the malware application does not pretend to be the bank, it mostly hides as a third-party app and therefore remains under the radar of the average user. Disguises used by Anubis where for example: fake mobile games, fake software updates, fake post/mail apps, fake flash-player apps, fake utility apps, fake browsers and even fake social-network and communication apps. The malware was rented privately to a limited number of \u201ccustomers\u201d; criminals willing to use such malware to perform fraud. At the moment of writing, the renting service is supposedly disrupted due to the author being under arrest or having simply vanished with customers\u2019 money, but the malware itself is alive and kicking. Through this blog post ThreatFabric experts revisit major stages of Anubis\u2019 evolution and explain what changes can be expected on the threat landscape. Origins: It all started with BankBot In December 2016 the actor \u201cmaza-in\u201d wrote an article named \u201cAndroid BOT from scratch\u201d in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed <e2>\u201cAndroid.BankBot.149.origin\u201d</e2>. Although being a generic name for banking malware, \u201cBankBot\u201d became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code.

STC was one of a number of Russian companies subject to sanctions by the Obama administration in December 2016 for being \"complicit in malicious cyber-enabled activities\" against the US. [SEP]", "[CLS] Logs collected by Check Point researchers show that every day <e1>Gooligan</e1> installs at least 30,000 apps fraudulently on breached devices or over 2 million apps since the campaign began. How does Gooligan work? The infection begins when a user downloads and installs a Gooligan-infected app on a vulnerable Android device. Our research team has found infected apps on third-party app stores, but they could also be downloaded by Android users directly by tapping malicious links in phishing attack messages. After an infected app is installed, it sends data about the device to the campaign\u2019s Command and Control (C&C) server. Gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the C&C server that takes advantage of multiple Android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known VROOT (CVE-2013-6282) and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153). These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user. If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely. After achieving root access, Gooligan downloads a new, malicious module from the C&C server and installs it on the infected device. This module injects code into running Google Play or GMS (Google Mobile Services) to mimic user behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection, a technique first seen with the mobile malware <e2>HummingBad</e2>. The module allows Gooligan to: Steal a user\u2019s Google email account and authentication token information Install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation Install adware to generate revenue Ad servers, which don\u2019t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not, send Gooligan the names of the apps to download from Google Play.

For example, an attacker can trigger the overlay as soon as the user sees the fake SMS message or push notification. Evolving New Features The Ginp malware continues to evolve rapidly, with developers frequently releasing new features. Several of these features are worth mentioning. Fake SMS Push Notifications This new feature was added December 2019. It is used for faking an incoming SMS message or push notification from the victim\u2019s bank. These techniques allow the attacker to employ social engineering before initiating an overlay attack and help decrease suspicion from a victim. Notifications Listener (Blocker) Service A few months ago, Ginp developers introduced a new feature that allows the malware to block all push notifications from legitimate applications. This is particularly helpful to attackers, as it can block notifications about the fraudulent transaction taking place, thus avoiding arousing suspicion from the victim. Additionally, the content of the blocked notification is sent to the C&C server, allowing malware operators to steal second-factor authentication codes or collect <e2>social media</e2> and instant messaging notifications to spy on the target.

Spam campaigns: using SMS or email, actors sent messages to social engineer the victims with a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware. Web-redirection of the victim to a fake landing page containing a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware; using advertisement on websites, hacked sites, traffic exchanges and other black hat SEO methods It is in the interest of the actors to infect as many devices as possible as it increases the chances to commit fraud successfully. The problem for Play Store users is that even without being social-engineered, due to the increasing number of Google Play malware campaigns, the risk of downloading a dropper mimicking a benign application has increased significantly.

Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by <e2>Frozen Cell</e2> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families.

Among the various features we discuss in this post, we believe that TrickMo\u2019s most significant novelty is an app recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by German banks. In the analysis that follows, we describe in detail the capabilities of this new variant and a \u201ckill switch\u201d that can remotely eliminate the malware from a mobile device. Why Do Desktop Trojans Use a Mobile Component? About a decade ago, attackers wielding banking Trojans could simply use stolen credentials to access a victim\u2019s online banking account and perform money transfers. As a countermeasure, financial institutions introduced various second factor authentication (2FA) methods. One method, which was popular in Germany, is known as mobile TAN (mTAN). It was implemented by sending an SMS message containing a one-time password (OTP) to the client\u2019s mobile device. The transaction would only be authorized after the client enters the TAN into the online banking website in their browser. Keep in mind that while this case is about TANs, it can be any OTP, depending on which bank is being targeted. Meanwhile, desktop banking Trojans developed the ability to execute various social engineering schemes by using web injections, a method that alters the content presented to the infected victim in their browser. In some cases, sophisticated web injects were used to trick victims into entering their 2FA codes directly into the web forms controlled by the malware to eliminate the need for the mobile malware component. But attackers were still constantly looking for new methods to steal TANs. Around 2011, the infamous <e2>Zeus</e2> Trojan started using web injects that tricked users into downloading a mobile component called \u201cZitMo\u201d (Zeus in the Mobile).

The New Attack Process The most current version of the trojan spreads via links sent in phishing SMSs that prompt the user to install an app. As it launches, the app requests device administrator rights, and then starts communicating with its C&C server. When first launching, the trojan checks to make sure the victim\u2019s device is located in Russia and that it isn\u2019t an emulator used by security researchers to spot malware. If the device checks out, the trojan registers with the mobile notification service Google Cloud Messaging and launches a service to check if the trojan has device administrator privileges, according researchers. \u201cIf the <e2>Trojan</e2> detects an attempt to revoke its administrator privileges, it starts periodically switching off the phone screen, trying to stop the user actions,\u201d researchers said.

But its wide-ranging access to mobile device functions is what sets it apart, Cloudmark researchers said. \u201cThe malware has been given the moniker TangleBot because of its many levels of obfuscation and control over a myriad of entangled device functions, including contacts, SMS and phone capabilities, call logs, internet access, [GPS], and camera and microphone,\u201d they noted in a Thursday writeup. To reach such a long arm into Android\u2019s internal business, TangleBot grants itself privileges to access and control all of the above, researchers said, meaning that the cyberattackers would now have carte blanche to mount attacks with a staggering array of goals. For instance, attackers can manipulate the incoming voice call function to block calls and can also silently make calls in the background, with users none the wiser. That\u2019s a perfect setup for premium number fraud, where the user is charged a high rate for making a call to an attacker-controlled toll number. TangleBot can also send, obtain and process text messages for SMS fraud, two-factor authentication interception, self-propagation to contacts and more. It also has deep spyware capabilities, with the ability to record or directly stream camera, screen or microphone audio directly to the attacker, along with \u201cother device observation capabilities,\u201d according to Cloudmark. Gaining access to the GPS functionality, for example, creates the potential for stalkery location-tracking.

In this analysis, we get into the capabilities of the new variant and what we found to be a \u201ckill switch\u201d that can eliminate the malware remotely from an infected device. Desktop Trojans and Their Mobile Component The process by which Trojans attempt to infect mobile devices is at least a decade old. Usually, when users are already infected with malware like TrickBot on their desktop, they will see a web injection asking for their mobile device operating system (OS) type and phone number. Next, if they indicate that they use an Android-based device, the Trojan, impersonating their bank with web injections, fools the victim into installing a fake security app. The supposed purpose of that app is to obtain and use a required \u201csecurity code\u201d to log in to their online banking site.

With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan\u2019s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan\u2019s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail. The Trojan\u2019s assets folder contained the file data.db with a list of possible values for the User-Agent field for the PAGE command (which downloads the specified webpage). If the value of this field failed to arrive from the C&C, it was selected from the file data.db using a pseudo-random algorithm. 2015\u20132016 Starting from mid-2015, the Trojan began using the AES algorithm to encrypt data communicated between the infected device and the C&C: Also starting with the same version, data is sent in a POST request to the relative address with the format \u201c/[number]\u201d (a pseudo-randomly generated number in the range 0\u20139999).

The malware works by accessing the target device in the disguise of an authentic app. As soon as the malware gains access to the device, it hides the app icon and asks for Accessibility Service permissions. When the user grants permission, it automatically gets dynamic permissions. Using these permissions, the malware can send messages, make calls and perform overlay attacks easily without alerting the user.

The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed \u201cAndroid.BankBot.149.origin\u201d. Although being a generic name for banking malware, \u201cBankBot\u201d became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used <e1>Bankbot</e1> for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later.

X-Force estimated the magnitude of campaigns on Google Play by the number of downloads, as well as the number and variety of payloads found. In one case, the researchers fetched more than 1,000 new samples of BankBot Anubis from just one C&C server. Each sample has a different MD5 signature, few of which were documented by any antivirus engine when tested against VirusTotal. Official App Stores: A Fraudster\u2019s Holy Grail When it comes to maximizing the results of infection campaigns, mobile malware operators consider official app stores to be the holy grail. Getting a malicious app into an official store yields greater exposure to more potential victims, a cheap distribution channel and user trust. Moreover, malware apps that have already made it into an official store are more likely to fly under the radar of security controls for longer than those hosted on hijacked sites or rogue servers. IBM X-Force reports malicious apps to the official stores to have them removed before more users can be affected. Malicious apps are a blight that both store operators and developers work hard to limit.

Multiple communication channels One of the features that make it stand out of the crowd is the use at the same time of three separate communication channels for receiving commands. The researchers found that it can get instructions via the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) service that delivers messages in JSON format to mobile devices. This channel, however, won't work beyond April 11, 2019, because Google has deprecated it. Another method Rotexy uses to deliver commands to the compromised target is from a command and control (C2) server, as it is typical for most malware. The third method is SMS based and allows the operator to control the actions of malware by sending a text message to the infected mobile phone. The latest version of Rotexy targeted mostly users located in Russia, although Kaspersky noticed victims in Ukraine, Germany, <e2>Turkey</e2>, and several other countries as well. [SEP]", "[CLS] Newer banking trojan apps Of course, <e1>Anubis</e1> is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at Cybereason Nocturnus recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. The new trojan, known as EventBot, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as Revolut and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others. The banking trojan targets users in the United States and European countries such as the UK, Germany, France, Spain, Switzerland, and Italy. Like Anubis, EventBot is currently distributed through third-party rogue app stores and malicious URLs. Once downloaded, EventBot amasses a carte blanche of permissions, including starting at bootup and maintaining a persistent background process allowing the app to monitor the smartphone continuously. The trojan also prevents the phone from sleeping and ignores battery optimization settings. EventBot also obtains control of Android\u2019s accessibility services to run a keylogger, receive notifications as well as retrieve the content of open windows.

If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram.

When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious RCSAndroid agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play. The role of ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A and the malicious APK mentioned in the first method is to exploit a local privilege escalation vulnerability in Android devices. Hacking Team has been known to use both CVE-2014-3153 and CVE-2013-6282 in their attacks. The said exploits will root the device and install a shell backdoor. The shell backdoor then installs the RCSAndroid agent. This agent has two core modules, the Evidence Collector and the Event Action Trigger. The Evidence Collector module is responsible for the spying routines outlined above. One of its most notable routines is capturing voice calls in real time by hooking into the \u201cmediaserver\u201d system service. The basic idea is to hook the voice call process in mediaserver. Take voice call playback process for example. The mediaserver will first builds a new unique track, start to play the track, loop play all audio buffer, then finally stop the playback. The raw wave audio buffer frame can be dumped in the getNextBuffer() function.

In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. But what makes the apps so effective is that they were downloadable from Android's official app store, Google Play, lending the apps a level of credibility. That's because most rudimentary malware apps don't get installed without an Android users actively lowering their own security settings in order to install apps outside of the supposedly protective wall of Google's app store. It's not unheard of for malware apps to sneak into the Android app store, but it is rare. An analysis of the Desert Scorpion app showed that its malicious functionality was not included in the app when submitted to Google Play, said Blaich. Rather, it was downloaded later when the user was interacting with the app. With ViperRAT, the malicious functionality within one of the apps looks almost indistinguishable from other social networking apps and obfuscated from view during the app store approval process. Andrew Blaich, Lookout's head of threat intelligence, said the Desert Scorpion app was installed more than a hundred times, while ViperRAT apps had about a thousand combined installs. What those may seem like a low numbers, Blaich said Desert Scorpion \"is a part of a targeted attack and not used for broad global-wide surveillance,\" and that \"this number is in line with what we would expect.\" After Lookout reached out, Google removed the apps from the app store. \"When we were notified by Lookout, we removed the apps from <e2>Play</e2> and updated Play Protect to help ensure users are secured,\" said a Google spokesperson.

ThreatFabric\u2019s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp\u2019s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity. Ginp\u2019s five-month evolution In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a \"Google Play Verificator\" app, primarily stealing SMS messages. In August, it posed as fake \u201cAdobe Flash Player\u201d apps targeting credit card information.

And lastly, it comes with self-destruction and removal functions, which allows the cybercrime gang behind TrickMo to remove all traces of the malware's presence from a device after a successful operation. The kill switch can also be activated by SMS, but IBM researchers found that it was possible to decrypt the encrypted SMS commands using a hard-coded RSA private key embedded in the source code, thus making it possible to generate the public key and craft an SMS message that can turn the self-destruct feature on.

Distribution As a rented Trojan, Anubis was distributed using a wide range of delivery techniques: Google Play campaigns: using self-made or rented droppers actors were able to bypass Google Play security mechanisms and spread the Trojan using the official app store, potentially infecting thousands of victims at a time. Spam campaigns: using SMS or email, actors sent messages to social engineer the victims with a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware. Web-redirection of the victim to a fake landing page containing a request to install or update some legitimate application, instead linking to the malware; using advertisement on websites, hacked sites, traffic exchanges and other black hat SEO methods It is in the interest of the actors to infect as many devices as possible as it increases the chances to commit fraud successfully. The problem for Play Store users is that even without being social-engineered, due to the increasing number of Google Play malware campaigns, the risk of downloading a dropper mimicking a benign application has increased significantly.

Android users, who are the prime targets, should also be on the lookout for suspicious messages and be wary of clicking links that require personal information or some sort of end user input. \u201cNCC hereby reiterates that mobile users are under obligation to practice safe messaging practices and avoid clicking on any links in texts, even if they appear to come from a legitimate contact. Indeed, it is important to be judicious when downloading apps by reading install prompts closely, looking out for information regarding rights and privileges that the app may request.\u201d-NCC Although TangleBot protects itself deletion, experts say, users can manually remove it from their device by using Android\u2019s safe boot. Users, who have clicked a suspicious link, can restart their phone and then reboot the device in safe mode. In the system settings, users can also restore the factory setting of their device. Users can also report SMS phishing and spam.

Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity. Ginp\u2019s five-month evolution In its first iteration, Ginp disguised itself as a \"Google Play Verificator\" app, primarily stealing SMS messages. In August, it posed as fake \u201cAdobe Flash Player\u201d apps targeting credit card information. The next version was enhanced with payload obfuscation and started targeting Snapchat and Viber users as well as specific banking apps. After that, the Ginp author borrowed code from the Anubis malware, whose source code was leaked earlier this year.

In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps.

That's because most rudimentary malware apps don't get installed without an Android users actively lowering their own security settings in order to install apps outside of the supposedly protective wall of Google's app store. It's not unheard of for malware apps to sneak into the Android app store, but it is rare. An analysis of the Desert Scorpion app showed that its malicious functionality was not included in the app when submitted to Google Play, said Blaich.

The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed \u201cAndroid.BankBot.149.origin\u201d. Although being a generic name for banking malware, \u201cBankBot\u201d became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: <e1>LokiBot</e1> (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind \u201cLokiBot\u201d, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report.

Is 2020 the year of smartphone malware? 2020 is the year of the rat, and we actually aren\u2019t talking about the Chinese horoscope. According to several cybersecurity researchers, 2020 has seen an explosive increase in Remote access Trojans, or \u201cRATs\u201d. This threat is not minor: a RAT can take control of your computer in the same way that a remote administrator would normally do, using tools such as TeamViewer or VNC. In this case, it\u2019s a malicious control: a RAT steals your personal information trying to carry out bank or identity fraud. However, and with the migration of PC users to the mobile world, hackers changed their strategy. Now there is a whole series of malware focused on bank credentials and identity theft, especially designed for Android mobile devices. These RATs have reached a high level of sophistication, and most are offered in the form of \u201cmalware as a service\u201d, or MaaS. Between 2019 and 2020 these attacks have become increasingly common. Names like Anubis, Hydra, <e2>Ginp</e2>, or Gustuff appear on all mobile malware lists on a recurring basis.

Once Gooligan has control of the phone, the victim's Google account token is siphoned off to a remote server and could be used to gain access to their Gmail, Docs, Drive, Photos and other data, even where two-factor authentication is turned on. Check Point's researchers were able to trace that server, uncovering a stash of 1.3 million real Google accounts. Looking at server logs, they were also able to determine as many as 30,000 apps were being downloaded every day by infected phones, reaching a total of 2 million so far. Hundreds of businesses' Google accounts have been hit too, Check Point warned. Previous multi-million leaks of Google accounts have proven false, most notably in 2014 when just two per cent of 5 million allegedly real logins leaked on the dark web turned out to work on active accounts, and in 2016 when only 460,000 of 23 million published online were deemed legitimate. Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers. Shaulov said the business model was similar to another group dubbed HummingBad, discovered in February this year. The Chinese cybercriminals behind HummingBad made $320,000 a month with that one initiative, according to Shaulov. He believes the Gooligan crooks are earning much the same.

To illustrate the level of threat the DEFENSOR ID app posed, we performed three tests. First, we launched a banking app and entered the credentials there. The credentials were immediately available in the leaky database \u2013 see Figure 6. Second, we wrote a test message in an email client.

The Conversations modified samples differ from the original one in the getKnownHosts method that was modified to replace the main XMPP host with the attackers\u2019 C2 server: It appears that the attackers were using a specific C2 for the use of that app. Another important modification is in the message transfer process: With this modification, an application sends device location coordinates with every message. There are also many other modifications, fully described in our private report. In addition, we did not see traces of the Smali injection. In this case we found traces of dx/dexmerge compilers, which means that, this time, the attackers just imported the original source code into an Android IDE (such as Android Studio, for instance) and compiled it with their own modifications. In addition to adding the code, the attackers also changed the icon and package name. We do not know why, but we suspect that it was an attempt to hide the origin of the application. Even when we originally thought this was a backdoored version of the Conversations app, used to infect victims, we didn\u00b4t discovered anything malicious in it.

Despite some minor refactoring, the architecture of the Trojan stayed the same. At the same time, the Cerberus team was making announcements about a soon-to-be-published second version of the Trojan in their commercial topic in an underground forum. Therefore, we initially assumed that the samples discovered are in fact the first/test versions of that advertised new version of the Trojan and classified them as such. That held until 5 days later. Enter the ring On January 18th, we discovered an interesting new post from another actor in an underground forum. This actor, whose name matches the newly introduced module name for the malware in question, started to advertise his own private malware with VNC feature. For the sake of clarity: Although VNC (Virtual Network Computing) is a specific graphical desktop-sharing system, threat actors often label all Trojans with remote access capabilities (RAT) as embedding VNC, regardless of the technology being used. This discovery also matched the fact that the newly found samples included the RAT feature, making use of TeamViewer to provide remote access to the infected device. The highly relatable codebase, showing the strong links between this new Trojan and Cerberus was conflicting with the fact that this Trojan was clearly operated by a separate group, therefore we decide to investigate the situation further. Luckily, it was only a matter of weeks before we could confirm what was going on. Meet the Duke In February, it became apparent that the new malware was operated separately and slightly differently than Cerberus. We started to see simultaneous campaigns using both Trojans. Additionally, the malware described by its apparent author was enriched by a 2FA stealing technique that was capable of stealing secret tokens from Google\u2019s Authenticator application, while Cerberus didn\u2019t have such a feature. Mid-February, the actor who later proclaimed himself author of the <e1>BlackRock</e1> malware left a review on the profile of the apparent author, reviewing his malware-rental service: On February 20th 2020, the Cerberus actors made a promotional post in their commercial topic that referenced researchers, sharing the samples of what they thought was the Cerberus malware.

Cerberus is an overlay-type mobile malware that emerged in mid-2019 but initially lacked advanced capabilities.

Cerberus was peddled in the underground as commodity malware until the summer of 2020, taking over the market share of Anubis, a previous pay-per-use malware. In September 2020, Cerberus\u2019 development team decided to disband, spurring an auction attempt that aimed to sell off the source code to the highest bidder, starting at $100,000. The code did not sell but was instead shared with the malware\u2019s customer base, which meant it was publicly leaked. That intentional release of the source code gave rise to numerous malware campaigns involving Cerberus and likely also led to this combined attack with the Ursnif banking Trojan. A Combination Attack From Desktop to Smartphone Ursnif is a very long-standing staple in the cybercrime arena, possibly the oldest banking Trojan that\u2019s still active today. Recent campaigns featuring this malware have been most notable in Italy, where it is typically delivered to business email recipients in attachments that purport to carry invoices, delivery notices or other business correspondence. The infection chain commonly involves poisoned macros, getting past email controls by featuring productivity files most organizations use. In some campaigns, the attackers keep access to the infection zone limited to Italian-based IP addresses only.

The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed \u201cAndroid.BankBot.149.origin\u201d. Although being a generic name for banking malware, \u201cBankBot\u201d became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities <e1>Razdel</e1> (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind \u201cLokiBot\u201d, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

The app, called WeMessage, is malicious, researchers said, and uses entirely different graphics and doesn\u2019t seem to impersonate the legitimate app other than by name. Researchers said, this malicious app does not have any real functionality, and only served as bait for installing the spyware. Researchers also said they don\u2019t know how this fake WeMessage app was distributed. Previous versions of the malware were distributed in apps via a fake Android app store, called the \u201cDigitalApps\u201d store. The fake app store distributed both legitimate apps as well as fake apps posing as AndroidUpdate, Threema and Telegram. However, researchers said that the fake WeMessage app was not on the \u201cDigitalApps\u201d store. New Updates Previously documented versions of this spyware have various capabilities, including the ability to take pictures, record audio, exfiltrate call logs, SMS messages and contacts and more. They would do so by requesting a number of invasive permissions, using social engineering-like techniques to fool technically inexperienced users. This latest version has extended surveillance capabilities, specifically targeting information collected from <e2>social media</e2> and messaging apps.

ThreatFabric\u2019s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp\u2019s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity.

Once a device is infected, it can start stealing personal and financial data, however, that\u2019s just a start; SpyNote has much more to do that includes installing new APKs and updating itself, copying files from device to computer, view all messages on the device, access the contact list, make and listen to your calls, record or listen to audio from the microphone of the device, collect Mac address from WI-FI, IMEI number and details about carrier, and track GPS location of the infected device. Simply put: the SpyNote RAT will control your device and users won\u2019t even know about it. The SpyNote APK requires victims to accept and give SpyNote many permissions, including the ability to edit text messages, read call logs and contacts, or modify or delete the contents of the SD card.

How RCSAndroid hacking tool infects a Target? RCSAndroid uses two different methods to infect targeted Android devices. 1. Hacking Team used text and email messages containing specially crafted URLs that triggered exploits for several vulnerabilities (CVE-2012-2825 and CVE-2012-2871) present in the default browsers of Android 4.0 Ice Cream to 4.3 Jelly Bean, allowing the attacker to gain root privileges, and install the RCSAndroid APK. 2. The company used backdoor apps such as \"BeNews\" available on the official Google Play Store to take advantage of a local privilege escalation bug to root the device and install the RCSAndroid agent. RCSAndroid has 4 'critical components': Penetration solutions \u2013 Methods to get into the device, either via SMS or email or a legitimate app Low-level native code \u2013 Advanced exploits and spy tools beyond Android's security framework High-level Java agent \u2013 The application's malicious APK Command-and-control (C&C) servers \u2013 Servers used to remotely send or receive malicious commands Given that the source code of RCSAndroid is now available to everybody, it will likely put Android users in danger. So, if you own a smartphone running any Android version from 4.0 Ice Cream to 4.3 Jelly Bean, you need to 'Get Rid of it Today.' \"The leaked RCSAndroid code is a commercial weapon now in the wild,\" security researchers wrote in a blog post. \"Mobile users are called on to be on top of this news and be on guard for signs of monitoring.

The malware, which the researchers said came from an Israeli company called NSO Group that was bought by the U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014, was used to target journalists and activists in some cases, according to Citizen Lab, a group focused on the intersection of technology and information security. Apple released a fix for the problems on Thursday. \"We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits,\" the company said in a statement. But the spyware highlights how even companies with strong security reputations struggle to compete with a robust market for hacking tools that give almost any government access to powerful digital surveillance measures. A spokesman for NSO Group, Zamir Dahbash, said the mobile hacking software is only sold to governments. \"The agreements signed with the company's customers require that the company's products only be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes,\" the spokesman said in a statement. The spyware came to light after pro-democracy activist Ahmed Mansoor received two text messages promising \"secrets\" about prisoners tortured in <e2>United Arab Emirates</e2> jails. [SEP]", "[CLS] Researchers believe that some of TrickMo\u2019s functionalities, specifically the ability to record targeted applications, help the trojan obtain a one-time password (OTP) or transaction authentication number, with the goal of bypassing 2FA protections put in place by <e2>banks</e2>. \u201cWe believe that TrickMo\u2019s most significant novelty is an app-recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by German banks,\u201d they said. Bypassing Authentication In most places, 2FA is implemented by sending an SMS message containing a OTP to a user\u2019s mobile device. However, SMS messages, as previous hacks have proved, can be intercepted. So, some banks in Europe (and especially in Germany) have taken these types of authentication measures a step further by using an app that sends push notifications to users (rather than texts). These notifications would contain the transaction details and the passcode. In Germany, the one-time security codes required to log in to mobile banking are known as a mobile TANs (mTANs), and the apps that do the push notifications are known as \u201cpushTAN\u201d apps. \u201cThe pushTAN method has a clear advantage: It improves security by mitigating the risk of SIM swapping attacks and SMS-stealers,\u201d said researchers. \u201cThe pushTAN method is a hurdle for malware apps that may reside on the same device, and it\u2019s particularly challenging for mobile malware due to Android\u2019s application sandbox. This feature is designed to block one application from accessing the data of other applications without rooting the device.\u201d TrickMo\u2019s features are designed to bypass this extra type of authentication \u2013 specifically, via its ability to record mobile phone screens.

The Cerberus malware component of the attack is used by Ursnif\u2019s operators to receive two-factor authentication codes sent by banks to their users when account updates and money transfer transactions are being confirmed in real-time. Cerberus also possesses other features and can enable the attacker to obtain the lock-screen code and remotely control the device. Cerberus is an overlay-type mobile malware that emerged in mid-2019 but initially lacked advanced capabilities. It has evolved over time to eventually feature the ability to hijack SMS content and control devices remotely, alongside other sophisticated data theft features. Cerberus was peddled in the underground as commodity malware until the summer of 2020, taking over the market share of <e1>Anubis</e1>, a previous pay-per-use malware. [SEP]", "[CLS] Last summer, after being tipped off by a political dissident in the UAE, <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> brought Lookout in to further investigate Pegasus. In August 2016, Lookout, with Citizen Lab, published research about the discovery of the iOS version of this threat. What we discovered was a serious mobile spyware operation that has since been reportedly used to target <e1>Mexican activists</e1>, according to The New York Times. [SEP]", "[CLS] Desert Scorpion has been tied to a 2017 campaign, known as Frozen Cell, by reuse of the same social media profiles to promote the malware as well as infrastructure using similar IP blocks. <e1>APT-C-23</e1> has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target\u2019s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target\u2019s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app\u2019s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion\u2019s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a \u201cdropper\u201d for malware pretending to be a settings application. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,\u201d said Andrew Blaich, Lookout\u2019s head of device intelligence. \u201cEspecially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn\u2019t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.\u201d Several of the malware\u2019s package names include the word \u201cFateh\u201d which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the Fatah political party.

Like Anubis, EventBot is currently distributed through third-party rogue app stores and malicious URLs. Once downloaded, EventBot amasses a carte blanche of permissions, including starting at bootup and maintaining a persistent background process allowing the app to monitor the smartphone continuously. The trojan also prevents the phone from sleeping and ignores battery optimization settings. EventBot also obtains control of Android\u2019s accessibility services to run a keylogger, receive notifications as well as retrieve the content of open windows. Although still in the development stage, the app may be a more significant threat to mobile banking compared to Anubis. Cybercriminals have discovered a lucrative target in the Android mobile banking and shopping industry.

They created a profile where the only thing I needed to do is buy it. However my goal was to obtain working sample and C&C address to properly analyze it.\" The developers sent Stefanko a sample of Cerberus, but used his Twitter handle \"instead of a real C&C server,\" and so he was unable to test it. Two days later, Stefanko and colleagues \"detected an active campaign using this new banking Trojan with thousands of website visits that contained the payload. Cerberus was spread via a fake website that asked users to install Adobe Flash Player.\" Stefanko explained to me that the Cerberus developers used \"a web framework where anyone can check website visit statistics\u2014because of that I found out which countries are targeted with actual number of site visits.\" Over a fourteen day period, Stefanko tracked more than 13,000 visits to the fake Cerberus website, most of which were from users in the U.S. and Japan. At about the same time, Cerberus was seen being rented out in underground forums by the team at <e1>ThreatFabric</e1>.

That sample indeed belongs to the same malware strain that we discovered earlier January. The revelation After we established a solid link between the actor running the private rental service and the samples, the only aspect we were missing was the name of the Trojan. Fortunately for us, after a while topics showing interest in a certain \u201cAlien\u201d malware started to appear in the underground forum and the author himself confirmed his affiliation to, and the name of, the Trojan: Based on our in-depth knowledge of the Trojan (available in our Mobile Threat Intelligence portal), we can prove that the Alien malware is a fork of the initial variant of Cerberus (v1), active since early January 2020 and rented out at the same time as Cerberus. Cerberus being discontinued, its customers seem to be switching to Alien, which has become the prominent new MaaS for fraudsters. Looking at what we know now about what happened with Cerberus and Alien, we could speculate that Cerberus was on the decline as the developers behind the Trojan shifted away from the project with the original source in order to start their own. Interestingly enough, this speculation is corroborated by the fact that when the second version of Cerberus (v2) was released in May 2020, it did not introduce any major new features, except for the one to steal 2FA codes from Google\u2019s authenticator app. The code of that feature code is almost identical to that introduced with the Alien Trojan in <e2>February 2020</e2>.

Lookout notified Google of the finding and Google removed the app immediately while also taking action on it in Google Play Protect. The app ties together two malware families - Desert Scorpion and another targeted surveillanceware family named FrozenCell - that we believe are being developed by a single, evolving surveillanceware actor called APT-C-23 targeting individuals in the Middle East. We've seen this actor rely heavily on phishing campaigns to trick victims into downloading their malicious apps, specifically on Facebook. Even sophisticated actors are using lower cost, less technologically impressive means like phishing to spread their malware because it's cheap and very effective, especially on mobile devices where there are more ways to interact with a victim (messaging apps, social media apps, etc.), and less screen real estate for victims to identify potential indicators of a threat. Lookout customers are protected against this threat and additionally we have included a list of IOCs at the end of this report. The potential actor and who they target Our current analysis strongly suggests Desert Scorpion is being deployed in targeted attacks against Middle Eastern individuals of interest specifically those in Palestine and has also been highlighted by other researchers. We have been able to tie the malware to a long-running Facebook profile that we observed promoting the first stage of this family, a malicious chat application called Dardesh via links to Google Play. The Lookout Threat Intelligence team identified that this same Facebook profile has also posted Google Drive links to Android malware belonging to the FrozenCell family attributed to APT-C-27. These factors, in combination with the fact that the command and control infrastructure used by <e1>Frozen Cell</e1> and Desert Scorpion resides in similar IP blocks, supports the theory that the same actor is responsible for operating, if not developing, both families.

This app, dubbed \u201cTrickMo\u201d by our team, is designed to bypass second factor and strong authentication pushed to bank customers when they need to authorize a transaction. While it\u2019s not the first of its kind, this Android malware app is more sophisticated than similar apps and possesses interesting features that enable its operators to steal transaction authorization codes from victims who download the app. According to our research, TrickMo is still under active development as we expect to see frequent changes and updates. While it can be used anywhere and target any bank or region, at this time, we are seeing it deployed specifically in Germany. Germany is one of the first attack turfs TrickBot spread to when it first emerged in 2016.

Our researchers first encountered Gooligan\u2019s code in the malicious SnapPea app last year. At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like <e1>Ghostpush</e1>, MonkeyTest, and Xinyinhe. [SEP]", "[CLS] In addition, <e1>Monokle</e1> has the ability to install trusted certificates which allow it to gain root access to the device. This allows the attackers to deploy unique capabilities in their quest to steal data. Much of this is achieved by exploiting accessibility services and tailoring them to steal data from third-party applications, as well as using the predictive-text dictionaries of the user to gain insight into the kinds of topic that interest them. The malware can also record the screen when it is being unlocked in order to reveal the victim's passcode. \"Monokle is advanced and full featured mobile surveillance software,\" Adam Bauer, senior staff security intelligence engineer and one of the investigators behind the research, told ZDNet. \"It could be used for any objective which would require surveillance through a mobile device.\" While Monokle currently only targets Android devices, researchers say several samples of the malware contain unused commands and data transfer objects which point to the existence of an iOS version, suggesting the group would like to target iPhones in future. The malware is thought to have been active in the wild since 2016, with small bursts of activity against targets in the Caucasus region -- which encompasses Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia -- as well as targets in Syria. The total number of compromised users currently isn't known. It's still uncertain how Monokle is distributed, but researchers note that some samples of the malware are built around trojanized versions of real applications, complete with the same appearance and functionality -- and that phishing could play a part in delivery. \"In similar attacks, such as Dark Caracal, we've observed the use of phishing attacks through messaging applications, SMS, or emails used to distribute this type of malware,\" said Bauer. Lookout has linked the infrastructure behind Monokle to Special Technology Centre (STC), a Russian company working out of <e2>St Petersburg</e2>. STC was one of a number of Russian companies subject to sanctions by the Obama administration in December 2016 for being \"complicit in malicious cyber-enabled activities\" against the US.

As of this writing, no files were hosted at any of the links. The threat actors seem to have abandoned these URLs and might be looking into other ways to reach more victims. Use of a shared hosting service to distribute malware is highly flexible and low cost for the threat actors. It is also much harder for network defenders or researchers to track a campaign where the infrastructure is a moving target. Many top providers in Russia offer cheap prices for their shared hosting services, and some even provide free 30-day trial periods. Threat actors can register subdomains through the hosting provider and use the provider\u2019s services for a short-period campaign. A few days later they can cancel the trial and do not need to pay a penny. In addition, these out-of-the-box hosting services usually provide better infrastructure than the attackers could manage to construct (or compromise) themselves. RuMMS Code Analysis All RuMMS samples share the same behaviors, major parts of which are shown in Figure 1.

Anubis now targets 188 legitimate banking and financial mobile applications, located mainly in the US, India, France, Italy, Germany, Australia, and Poland. If a victim downloads and executes an Anubis app masquerading as a legitimate service, they are opening themselves up to the malware's wide variety of hijacking capabilities. Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram. Operators of the malware have been using Twitter and Google short links to send remote commands to the malware. The majority of which appear to be Turkish, according to the language settings used by social media accounts sending commands. Once commands have been accepted, Anubis can hijack devices, steal data, and send information to command-and-control (C2) servers which have spread worldwide. The new variants are also able to detect if they are running on virtual machines (VMs), a common way for researchers to safely unpack and analyze malware. In Anubis' case, this also includes Android emulators such as Genymotion. Anubis is not the only Android malware variant which is being constantly improved and refined by its developers.

This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications.

The first method is to send a specially crafted URL to the target via SMS or email. The URL will trigger exploits for arbitrary memory read (CVE-2012-2825) and heap buffer overflow (CVE-2012-2871) vulnerabilities in the default browsers of Android versions 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich to 4.3 Jelly Bean, allowing another local privilege escalation exploit to execute. When root privilege is gained, a shell backdoor and malicious RCSAndroid agent APK file will be installed. The second method is to use a stealthy backdoor app such as ANDROIDOS_HTBENEWS.A, which was designed to bypass Google Play.

Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: LokiBot (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks <e1>MysteryBot</e1> (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind \u201cLokiBot\u201d, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

Lookout said there is \"currently no evidence\" the actor successfully deployed it against the Israeli Defense Force this time around, but did not name a new target. Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be \"highly active\" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party <e2>Fatah</e2>. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps.

Whoever is behind the attack is rapidly expanding an advertising fraud campaign, said Shaulov. The attackers have forced victims to download and give positive reviews to apps on Google Play, which provides an illicit revenue stream as the hackers also run advertisements within the applications. Every download and every click on the ad adds a small amount to the attackers' coffers.

Static code analysis indicates that the malware, after successful installation, would install a legitimate application embedded in the APK file at res/raw/google.apk. Also, screenshots of cracked SpyNote server v6.4.4 proves that functionality: The adversary can pick a name of the application, service, its version, and the name of a victim to be able to differentiate them. This value can be extracted from the res/values/strings.xml file. In this particular example they were set as follows: Android applications, including malware, can listen for the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast event to ensure the application will be activated upon device start up, and this is the technique that SpyNote utilizes to achieve its persistence mechanism. As per the AndroidManifest.xml file, the class that is receiving the BOOT_COMPLETED event is com.android.tester.C4: This class waits for the BOOT_COMPLETED broadcast, checks if the com.android.tester.C11 service is already running, and, if not, initiates it. The service is responsible for processing commands received from the C2 server and is also the class where most of the code resides. SpyNote is able to discover installed applications, so that the attackers can tell which security appliances are deployed to a device.

The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed \u201cAndroid.BankBot.149.origin\u201d. Although being a generic name for banking malware, \u201cBankBot\u201d became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: <e1>LokiBot</e1> (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind \u201cLokiBot\u201d, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code.

In many instances, the spyware was used by oppressive government regimes to spy on journalists, human rights defenders, opposition politicians, lawyers, and anti-corruption advocates. But new data published today by <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> researchers reveals the existence of 36 different groups who deployed the Pegasus spyware against targets located in 45 countries, including the US, France, Canada, Switzerland, and the UK, countries known to have solid and democratic regimes in place.

Infecting iOS Devices We observed the first sample of DualToy capable of infecting iOS devices on June 7, 2015 (SHA-256: f2efc145d7d49b023d97a5857ad144dd03a491b85887312ef401a82b87fb1b84). Later in 2016, a new variant appeared. Our analysis below focuses primarily on the first variant. During execution, the sample will drop some PE and .ini files. Among them, insapp.dll is the module used to infect an iOS device. It was developed using Delphi and C++ and then packed with a standard UPX packer. There\u2019s another file, insapp.ini, which contains configurations including URLs to download iTunes drivers as well as iOS apps to install. Download and install iTunes After being loaded, the insapp.dll will check whether iTunes is installed on the infected computer. If not, it will download two MSI format installers from its C2 server. For example, for a 64-bit Windows PC, \u201cAppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi\u201d and \u201cAppleApplicationSupport64.msi\u201d will be downloaded. These two installers are part of Apple\u2019s official iTunes for Windows software that contains all necessary driver files that iTunes uses to interact with iOS devices.

One recent addition to the banking malware web-based control panel is the eyeball icon. This functionality allows hackers to know when the device user is looking at the screen. On detecting user activity, the hackers can avoid performing malicious activity on the smartphone while under the prying eyes of the smartphone owner. The threat actors are also working on integrating Yandex maps into the banking malware to decipher the location of the infected phone. However, this new addition is just a convenience feature because the banking malware operators can detect the location of the infected device by using other means such as the mobile network connected the device is connected to. Newer banking trojan apps Of course, Anubis is not the only exciting new banking malware. Researchers at Cybereason Nocturnus recently discovered a new banking trojan app that can steal banking and financial information targeted at Android users in March 2020. The new trojan, known as EventBot, targets over 200 apps such as PayPal Business, banking apps belonging to financial institutions such as <e2>Revolut</e2> and Barclays, and other financial apps such as TransferWise and CoinBase among others.

Once installed, the application requests permissions so that it may control SMS messages and steal sensitive data on the device, as well as proliferate to other devices in the target device\u2019s contact list. Cybereason's investigation shows that the threat actor behind the FakeSpy campaign is a Chinese-speaking group dubbed \"Roaming Mantis\", a group that has led similar campaigns. FakeSpy has been in the wild since 2017; this latest campaign indicates that it has become more powerful. Code improvements, new capabilities, anti-emulation techniques, and new, global targets all suggest that this malware is well-maintained by its authors and continues to evolve. INTRODUCTION For the past several weeks, <e1>Cybereason</e1> has been investigating a new version of Android malware dubbed FakeSpy, which was first identified in October 2017 and reported again in October 2018. [SEP]", "[CLS] Close-up of an icon on a smartphone screen <e1>Pegasus</e1> can infiltrate a smartphone via the widely used messaging app WhatsApp without the phone\u2019s user noticing. Christoph Scholz/Flickr, CC BY-SA Since 2019, Pegasus users have been able to install the software on smartphones with a missed call on WhatsApp, and can even delete the record of the missed call, making it impossible for the the phone\u2019s owner to know anything is amiss. Another way is by simply sending a message to a user\u2019s phone that produces no notification. This means the latest version of this spyware does not require the smartphone user to do anything. All that is required for a successful spyware attack and installation is having a particular vulnerable app or operating system installed on the device. This is known as a zero-click exploit. Once installed, Pegasus can theoretically harvest any data from the device and transmit it back to the attacker. It can steal photos and videos, recordings, location records, communications, web searches, passwords, call logs and social media posts. It also has the capability to activate cameras and microphones for real-time surveillance without the permission or knowledge of the user. Who has been using Pegasus and why NSO Group says it builds Pegasus solely for governments to use in counterterrorism and law enforcement work. The company markets it as a targeted spying tool to track criminals and terrorists and not for mass surveillance. The company does not disclose its clients. The earliest reported use of Pegasus was by the Mexican government in 2011 to track notorious drug baron Joaqu\u00edn \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n. The tool was also reportedly used to track people close to murdered Saudi journalist <e2>Jamal Khashoggi</e2>. It is unclear who or what types of people are being targeted and why. [SEP]", "[CLS] Yes, this time researchers have found a source code to a new piece of weaponized android malware that had the capability to infect millions of Android devices even when users are running latest versions of the android mobile operating system. <e1>Trend Micro</e1> researchers found that the Italian spyware company was selling RCSAndroid (Remote Control System Android), which they says, is one of the \"most professionally developed and sophisticated\" pieces of Android malware a.k.a Android hacking tool they have ever seen. RCSAndroid is a sophisticated, real-world surveillance and hacking tool that provides even unskilled hackers to deploy one of the world's more advanced surveillance suites for Google's mobile operating system Android. List of Creepy Features of Android Hacking Tool Once installed on targets' devices, RCSAndroid would have helped government and law enforcement agencies around the world to completely compromise and monitor Android devices remotely. Here are some of the features of RCSAndroid include the ability to: Capture screenshots using the 'screencap' command and framebuffer direct reading Collect passwords for Wi-Fi networks and online accounts, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Skype, and LinkedIn Collect SMS, MMS, and Gmail messages Capture real-time voice calls in any network or application by hooking into the 'mediaserver' system service Capture photos using the front and back cameras Monitor clipboard content Record using the microphone Record location Gather device information Collect contacts and decode messages from IM accounts, including WhatsApp, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat, Viber, Line, Hangouts, and BlackBerry Messenger. RCSAndroid Android hacking tool had been in the wild since 2012 and has been known to Citizen Lab researchers since last year when the security firm detailed a Hacking Team backdoor used against Android users in <e2>Saudi Arabia</e2>. How RCSAndroid hacking tool infects a Target? [SEP]", "[CLS] Logs collected by <e2>Check Point</e2> researchers show that every day Gooligan installs at least 30,000 apps fraudulently on breached devices or over 2 million apps since the campaign began. How does Gooligan work? The infection begins when a user downloads and installs a Gooligan-infected app on a vulnerable Android device. Our research team has found infected apps on third-party app stores, but they could also be downloaded by Android users directly by tapping malicious links in phishing attack messages. After an infected app is installed, it sends data about the device to the campaign\u2019s Command and Control (C&C) server. Gooligan then downloads a rootkit from the C&C server that takes advantage of multiple Android 4 and 5 exploits including the well-known VROOT (CVE-2013-6282) and Towelroot (CVE-2014-3153). These exploits still plague many devices today because security patches that fix them may not be available for some versions of Android, or the patches were never installed by the user. If rooting is successful, the attacker has full control of the device and can execute privileged commands remotely. After achieving root access, Gooligan downloads a new, malicious module from the C&C server and installs it on the infected device. This module injects code into running Google Play or GMS (Google Mobile Services) to mimic user behavior so Gooligan can avoid detection, a technique first seen with the mobile malware <e1>HummingBad</e1>. The module allows Gooligan to: Steal a user\u2019s Google email account and authentication token information Install apps from Google Play and rate them to raise their reputation Install adware to generate revenue Ad servers, which don\u2019t know whether an app using its service is malicious or not, send Gooligan the names of the apps to download from Google Play. [SEP]", "[CLS] At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like Ghostpush, <e1>MonkeyTest</e1>, and Xinyinhe. By late 2015, the malware\u2019s creators had gone mostly silent until the summer of 2016 when the malware reappeared with a more complex architecture that injects malicious code into Android system processes. The change in the way the malware works today may be to help finance the campaign through fraudulent ad activity. The malware simulates clicks on app advertisements provided by legitimate ad networks and forces the app to install on a device. An attacker is paid by the network when one of these apps is installed successfully. Logs collected by Check Point researchers show that every day Gooligan installs at least 30,000 apps fraudulently on breached devices or over 2 million apps since the campaign began.

[SEP]", "[CLS] And as the recent leak of <e1>National Security Agency</e1> hacking tools shows, malware that relies on unpatched bugs can leave the public at risk if exposed. Governments and companies such as the NSO Group that develop hacking tools instead of disclosing the flaws to developers can also threaten the security of all users because there\u2019s no guarantee others won\u2019t discover the same problems, some say. \u201cGovernment use of malware and the stockpiling of vulnerabilities imposes a cost on the rest of society,\u201d said Chris Soghoian, a technologist with the American Civil Liberties Union. \u201cIt's not like terrorists are using different phones from the rest of us.\u201d Apple devices have long had a reputation for security, according to Forrester Research principal analyst Jeff Pollard \u2014 one highlighted earlier this year when the company faced down the <e2>FBI</e2> in a legal battle over an encrypted iPhone used by one of the San Bernardino, Calif. [SEP]", "[CLS] The infrastructure used included servers in Germany, <e2>France</e2>, U.K., and Italy using cloud providers Aruba, Choopa, CloudSigma and DigitalOcean, according to the firm. \u201cBecause these anomalous iCloud connections occurred\u2014and ceased\u2014immediately prior to Pegasus installation\u2026we believe they represent the initial vector by which Tamer Almisshal\u2019s phone was hacked,\u201d researchers said. More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple\u2019s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it\u2019s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target \u2014 no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal\u2019s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses \u2013 likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal\u2019s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. \u201cWhile some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,\u201d researchers noted. Attribution The phones were hacked via four distinct clusters of servers, which could be attributable to up to four NSO Group operators, according to Citizen Labs. \u201cAn operator that we call Monarchy spied on 18 phones, and an operator that we call Sneaky Kestral spied on 15 phones, including one of the same phones that Monarchy spied on,\u201d Citizen Lab noted. \u201cTwo other operators, Center-1 and Center-2, spied on one and three phones, respectively.\u201d The firm believes with \u201cmedium confidence\u201d that <e1>Sneaky Kestrel</e1> acts on behalf of the UAE. [SEP]", "[CLS] Monokle has likely been used to target individuals in the Caucasus regions and individuals interested in the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria, among others, according to Lookout\u2019s analysis of the apps in question; for instance, a trojanized app called <e1>Ahrar Maps</e1> made the rounds in Syria during early 2017, offered through a third-party site that advertises association with Ahrar al-Sham. \u201cThere is some evidence pointing to potential targets within configuration files and titles of applications that contained Monokle,\u201d according to the report. \u201cBased on titles and icons of certain applications, we conclude that individuals in the following groups are targets of Monokle: Individuals that are interested in Islam; individuals that are interested in or associated with the Ahrar al-Sham militant group in Syria; individuals living in or associated with the Caucasus regions of Eastern Europe; and individuals that may be interested in a messaging application called \u2018UzbekChat\u2019 referencing the Central Asian nation and former Soviet republic Uzbekistan.\u201d In several Android samples of Monokle, there are unused commands and data transfer objects (DTOs) that suggest the existence of an iOS version of the client, though no iOS versions have been yet seen in the wild. \u201cThese classes and commands appear to serve no purpose as part of the Android client and may have been generated and included in it unintentionally,\u201d according to the report. Attribution After looking at the configuration files of multiple samples from the malware family, Lookout found that they rely on at least 22 different command-and-control servers and have specified control phones that use the +7 country code of Russia. Researchers attributed the RAT to Special Technology Center (STC), a Russian defense contractor that was previously sanctioned by the U.S. government under President Obama, for interfering in the <e2>2016</e2> presidential elections.

Abdulaziz was in contact with fellow dissent Jamal Khashoggi before the latter was lured to the Saudi consulate in Turkey, tortured, and murdered last year. Citizen Lab and Mexican NGOs have also reported that the <e1>Mexican government</e1> has used Pegasus to illegally spy on journalists, lawyers, and activists, and NSO Group has reportedly sold its tools to a number of autocratic regimes. [SEP]", "[CLS] In another case cited in the <e2>Citizen Lab</e2> report, a journalist in Mexico who had covered a corruption scandal involving the country\u2019s president appears to have been targeted with text messages that included links designed to look as if they came from a prominent Mexican news outlet. Apple rushed to fix the problem after Citizen Lab and Lookout alerted the company. Mansoor was targeted Aug. 10 and 11, and the company was able to figure out a solution within 10 days of being notified, according to the researchers. But details from the malware suggest that it has been in use for years, according to the researchers. The risk to everyday users may have been limited because the NSO Group says it sells its spyware only to governments. The NSO Group spokesman told The Post that it has no knowledge of the incidents involving Mansoor or the Mexican journalist and does not operate any of the malware systems itself. However, past research has shown that repressive regimes sometimes use this type of spyware against dissidents and journalists.

[SEP]", "[CLS] TangleBot: New text message-based malware capable of defrauding Android users The Nigerian Communications Commission (<e2>NCC</e2>) recently announced the existence of a new high-risk, a critical and short messaging service-based malware named TangleBot. In a press statement released by the commission, Dr. Ikechukwu Adinde, Director of Public Affairs, explained that TangleBot only infects Android mobile devices. He added that: \u201cThe disclosure on TangleBot was made in a recent security advisory made available to the Commission\u2019s New Media and Information Security Department by the Nigerian <e1>Computer Emergency Response Team</e1> (ngCERT).

X-Force estimated the magnitude of campaigns on Google Play by the number of downloads, as well as the number and variety of payloads found. In one case, the researchers fetched more than 1,000 new samples of BankBot Anubis from just one C&C server. Each sample has a different MD5 signature, few of which were documented by any antivirus engine when tested against VirusTotal. Official App Stores: A Fraudster\u2019s Holy Grail When it comes to maximizing the results of infection campaigns, mobile malware operators consider official app stores to be the holy grail. Getting a malicious app into an official store yields greater exposure to more potential victims, a cheap distribution channel and user trust. Moreover, malware apps that have already made it into an official store are more likely to fly under the radar of security controls for longer than those hosted on hijacked sites or rogue servers. <e1>IBM X-Force</e1> reports malicious apps to the official stores to have them removed before more users can be affected. [SEP]", "[CLS] It had again cloned a different legitimate Japanese website to host its malicious app, similar to what <e1>FakeSpy</e1> had also done before. Their similarity is made more apparent by looking at their naming method for downloadable files, domain structure of fake websites and other details of their deployment techniques, exemplified in figure 10. XLoader 6.0 also mirrors the way FakeSpy hides its real C&C server. When before it had used several different social media platforms, it now uses the Twitter platform, something FakeSpy has done in its past attacks. Analysis of the malicious iOS profile also revealed further connections, as the profile can also be downloaded from a website that FakeSpy deployed early this year. Conclusion and security recommendations The continued monitoring of XLoader showed how its operators continuously changed its features, such as its attack vector deployment infrastructure and deployment techniques. This newest entry seems to indicate that these changes won\u2019t be stopping soon. Being aware of this fact can help create defensive strategies, as well as prepare for upcoming attacks. In addition, just as uncovering new characteristics is important, finding ones we\u2019ve also seen in a different malware family like FakeSpy also provides valuable insight. Links between XLoader and FakeSpy can give clues to the much broader inner workings of the threat actors behind them. Perhaps more information on XLoader will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple\u2019s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices. Following simple best practices, like strictly downloading applications or any files from trusted sources and being wary of unsolicited messages, can also prevent similar attacks from compromising devices.

Victims\u2019 first encounter with the malware reportedly comes via an unsolicited text message that their Android smartphone receives. The txt message uses social engineering to dupe unsuspecting users into clicking on a link to a downloadable Android application. CSIS provided a (sanitised) version of a typical message to warn users what to look out for: \u201cYou have received a multimedia message from +[country code] [sender number] Follow the link http://www.mmsforyou[.]net/mms.apk to view the message\u201d Once the APK package is downloaded, potential victims are urged to grant the malicious app a wide range of permissions on their Android device: SEND_SMS RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED INTERNET SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW WRITE_SMS ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE WAKE_LOCK GET_TASKS CALL_PHONE RECEIVE_SMS READ_PHONE_STATE READ_SMS ERASE_PHONE Once installed, MazarBOT downloads a copy of Tor onto users\u2019 Android smartphones and uses it to connect anonymously to the net before sending a text message containing the victim\u2019s location to an Iranian mobile phone number. With the malware now in place, a number of actions can be performed, including allowing attackers to secretly monitor and control smartphones via a backdoor, send messages to premium-rate numbers, and intercept two-factor authentication codes sent by online banking apps and the like. In fact, with full access to the compromised Android smartphone, the opportunities for criminals to wreak havoc are significant \u2013 such as erasing infected phones or launching man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.

The story repeats itself Looking at actual situation for Anubis, several scenarios are possible: Actors having access to relevant resources continue using Anubis in it\u2019s actual state Some actor or actor group will step in and will become the new maintainer of Anubis, business starts over Actors stop using Anubis and wait for some new banking malware to become available Actors having access to relevant resources will start to modify and improve the existing code base to create their own malware As mentioned before, Anubis itself is based on the Bankbot Trojan, which was made public on purpose. This resulted in the appearance of at least 4 distinctive malware families/variants as shown in the picture hereunder: We can say that Anubis itself also sprung into existence from the publicly available BankBot code. Considering the increasing demand for Android banking malware and the fact that unobfuscated versions of the bot and the code of the admin panel of Anubis are publicly available we can definitely expect similar events. Anubis statistics As Anubis is a rented banking Trojan, each buyer/operator can decide the effective list of applications the Trojan should target. This results in many different campaigns with different objectives. Although there have been several different campaigns targeting different sets of applications, when considering the average Anubis sample, the number of targets is approximately 370 unique applications.

Although the ThreatFabric team discovered several new banking Trojans, it also observed the death of some others. Threat actors continue to innovate and try out new ways to steal and monetize personal information. In some cases, actors are successful, with long-running campaigns powered by their malware, in other cases, they are fruitless, resulting in the downfall of their malware, as quickly as it appeared. In this blog, we describe a relatively new and barely known Android banking Trojan with Remote Access Trojan, notification stealing and authenticator-based 2FA theft capabilities, dubbed Alien, and explain how it relates to infamous Cerberus malware, who\u2019s service has recently been discontinued. The preface, Cerberus August 2020 marked the demise of Cerberus, the most successful Android banking Trojan service, or MaaS (Malware as a Service), of the last 12 months. Details about the Trojan can be found in our blog about from August last year. Apparently due to issues related to shortcomings of the staff within the threat actor\u2019s technical team, architectural and technical issues with the Trojan remained unsolved long enough for Google Play Protect to detect all related samples on the spot on all infected devices, of course resulting in unhappy customers. At the <e2>end of July</e2>, because of these issues, the actor behind Cerberus tried to sell the service, including the customer portfolio, in the hopes another actor would continue his work.

By removing all the key instances (**pE2**) from the string, we produced the same string from the January sample: With 10 downloaders at this point, the campaign appears to be scaling up. Over time, we\u2019ve seen the code evolve. As time went by between downloader versions, the developers added a simple obfuscation and expanded the downloader capabilities.

Once a user downloads one of these malicious apps into their devices and opens it, a popup overlay will appear prompting the user to enter their login credentials. The credentials are then sent to a Command and Control (C&C server) that the attackers control. Red Alert 2.0 will block incoming calls from banks, presumably to block verification attempts. The malware also intercepts SMS text messages, sending messages to the attackers for future use. By disrupting the device\u2019s actual communication capabilities, the attackers can maximize the time spent doing malicious activities. According to its researchers, Red Alert 2.0 is being peddled on hacking forums for $500\u2014a low price that could make it attractive to a large number of potential attackers. Red Alert 2.0 can target mobile devices that are running Android versions of up to 6.0, which was released two years ago, but it is currently confined to third party app stores. No versions of the malicious apps carrying the malware have been detected on the official Google Play Store as of the time of publication.

His post gets removed by the admin quite quickly. We can conclude that the Anubis Trojan is no longer officially rented. However, ThreatFabric experts have observed certain Anubis customers having access to the builder and admin panel, which explains why the operations have not been totally disrupted. Although it is hard to say why maza-in really vanished, the fact that some code has been leaked combined with recent observations of unobfuscated Anubis samples in the wild, may suggest that the malware will be used by other actors and thus remain active. Marcher In 2016, the operations of another popular Android banking malware named Marcher were disrupted in a similar way to what happened to Anubis. The actor behind the Marcher Trojan got banned and the renting service was discontinued. The renting model of that Trojan allowed purchase of the APK (bot) builder, therefore a number of Marcher actors obtained the source code of the admin panel and the bot itself. Some of them resold the sources and some of them used them as a base for their own banking malware; therefore, although operations were disrupted the Trojan remained active for a while and new malware families emerged. Examples of modern families based on Marcher are: ExoBot Gustuff DiseaseBot <e2>Bubabot</e2> Neobot Even now it sometimes happens that some new Marcher-based Trojans appear on the threat-landscape.

ThreatFabric\u2019s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp\u2019s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities. Notably, Ginp can trick the victim into giving out login credentials and credit card details by claiming that these pieces of information are a prerequisite to validate user identity.

The agent appears to have been under development for at least five years and consists of three stages. First, there is a small dropper, then a large second stage payload that contains multiple binaries (where most of the surveillance functionality is implemented), and finally a third stage which typically uses the DirtyCOW exploit (CVE-2016-5195) to obtain root. Security Without Borders has recently published an analysis of this family, independently, through their blog. Several technical details indicated that the software was likely the product of a well-funded development effort and aimed at the lawful intercept market. These included the use of certificate pinning and public key encryption for C2 communications, geo-restrictions imposed by the C2 when delivering the second stage, and the comprehensive and well implemented suite of surveillance features. Early versions of the Android application used infrastructure which belonged to a company named Connexxa S.R.L. and were signed using the name of an engineer who appears to hold equity in Connexxa. This engineer\u2019s name is also associated with a company called eSurv S.R.L. eSurv\u2019s public marketing is centered around video surveillance software and image recognition systems, but there are a number of individuals claiming to be mobile security researchers working at the company, including one who has publically made claims to be developing a mobile surveillance agent. Moreover, eSurv was a business unit of Connexxa and was leased to eSurv S.R.L in 2014. This business unit and the eSurv software and brand was sold from Connexxa S.R.L. to eSurv S.R.L. on Feb 28, 2016.

On a semi-regular basis, I receive emails from users who have Android devices that show all the signs of being infected by malware. Without fail and without question, I quickly discover the user installed an application from a third-party, untrusted source. The user wanted an app, so they googled the app, and clicked on the first search result. Under normal circumstances, that first result is the Google Play Store. But when the app is not free, some users will turn to sites that promise to hand out that same application, sans cost. Recently a new security threat emerged that should make everyone squeamish about sideloading Android applications. What is sideloading? With the Android platform, you can install applications in the normal fashion (i.e., by finding them on the Google Play Store and tapping Install), or you can download the APK file (a file ending with .apk) and install it by tapping that file from within a file manager on your Android device. When you install via the second approach\u2013which is called sideloading\u2013you bypass all of the security checks done via the Google Play Store\u2019s vetting process. That is when trouble occurs. Many times those applications found on less-than-reputable sites can even seem like the same versions of legitimate apps. You might think you\u2019re installing Pokemon Go, but what you\u2019re really installing is a version of that particular app with baked-in malicious code. How does this happen?

[SEP]", "[CLS] Origins: It all started with <e1>BankBot</e1> In December 2016 the actor \u201cmaza-in\u201d wrote an article named \u201cAndroid BOT from scratch\u201d in which he shared source code of a new Android banking Trojan capable of sending and intercepting text messages as well as performing overlay attacks to steal credentials. The article received a lot of attention as it contained sources of both the C2 panel and the Android client (bot), giving actors the tools to create a working banking Trojan with minimum effort. The first malware based on the code from this article was spotted by Dr. Web in Jan 2017 and was dubbed \u201cAndroid.BankBot.149.origin\u201d. Although being a generic name for banking malware, \u201cBankBot\u201d became the name attributed to all Trojans derived from the shared source code. Throughout 2017, many actors used Bankbot for their fraudulent operations, but without proper support and updates most abandoned the malware months later. Some however used the source code to build their own malware. Some examples are: <e2>LokiBot</e2> (2017) - the actor behind this malware adapted the original code and introduced the ransomware and proxy capabilities Razdel (2017) - a banking malware that primarily target Central European banks, introduced a novel trick to implement overlay attacks MysteryBot (2018) - another malware from the same actor that was behind \u201cLokiBot\u201d, introduced a novel keylogging approach and on-device fraud technique CometBot (2019) - a copy of the original code with minor modifications, primarily targeting German banks at the moment Although most actors reusing the original code changed the Trojan into something that suited their respective needs, all of them also kept the original features from the original shared code. [SEP]", "[CLS] In the background, the injection\u2019s code couples the phone number inserted by the victim with the bot ID the <e1>Ursnif</e1> malware assigned to that infected desktop, the bank\u2019s name the victim uses and their login credentials as grabbed by Ursnif. Notice the use of the word \u2018Jambo\u2019 in parts of the code. It is most likely that Ursnif\u2019s operators wrote a jQuery library to simplify HTML Document Object Model tree traversal and manipulation, using it to orchestrate their injections. Fraudsters can use the library to define the amounts to transfer from accounts and other parameters of the fraudulent transaction. If the victims submit their phone number on the web injection, the remote server will send back a download URL for them to unknowingly download the Cerberus malware. This injection also keeps the victims\u2019 device identifiers linked to their bot ID and account credentials. Cerberus in Action Cerberus campaigns have already been detected spreading through the official Google Play store in the past, but this distribution attempts to land on victim devices through a third-party source \u2014 the attacker\u2019s domains. The option to sideload APKs is not enabled by default on Android devices, and the choice to deliver the malware from a non-official source may have limited the spread of the campaign to a larger number of devices. When Cerberus is downloaded to a new device, it takes into account the original bank name the victim attempted to access when the infection process was initiated. A JavaScript function includes those details and ensures the victim continues to see a consistent message. Here too, the \u2018Jambo\u2019 word repeats throughout the function, calling into action the jQuery library that orchestrates the malware\u2019s script-based activity. Cerberus is being used here only as the component that allows the attackers to bypass the bank\u2019s SMS-code verification challenge. The fraudulent transaction itself takes place on the victims\u2019 infected desktops (Windows-based devices). While most fraud is in-session using <e2>Gozi SOCK</e2> proxy capability, some access to the victim\u2019s account came from other devices. [SEP]", "[CLS] This malware sold to governments could help them spy on iPhones, researchers say Many people assume their iPhones are secure, but new research sent <e1>Apple</e1> scrambling to fix vulnerabilities that left users at risk. Spyware relying on three previously unknown, or \u201czero-day,\u201d flaws in Apple\u2019s iOS mobile operating system for years made it possible for governments to take over victims' phones by tricking them into clicking on a link in a text message, according to new reports from Lookout, a cybersecurity firm that looks for security holes in mobile products, and Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto\u2019s Munk School of Global Affairs. \"This is the most sophisticated bad actor we have ever seen targeting mobile phones out in the wild,\" said Mike Murray, vice president of security research at Lookout. The malware, which the researchers said came from an Israeli company called NSO Group that was bought by the U.S. private equity firm Francisco Partners in 2014, was used to target journalists and activists in some cases, according to Citizen Lab, a group focused on the intersection of technology and information security. Apple released a fix for the problems on Thursday. \"We advise all of our customers to always download the latest version of iOS to protect themselves against potential security exploits,\" the company said in a statement. But the spyware highlights how even companies with strong security reputations struggle to compete with a robust market for hacking tools that give almost any government access to powerful digital surveillance measures. A spokesman for NSO Group, Zamir Dahbash, said the mobile hacking software is only sold to governments. \"The agreements signed with the company's customers require that the company's products only be used in a lawful manner. Specifically, the products may only be used for the prevention and investigation of crimes,\" the spokesman said in a statement.

TangleBot Android malware is installed when an unsuspecting user clicks on a malicious link disguised as COVID-19 vaccination appointment-related information in an SMS message or information about fake local power outages that are due to occur. The aim behind both or either of the messages (on COVID-19 or impending power outages) is to encourage potential victims to follow a link that supposedly offers detailed information. Once at the page, users are asked to update applications such as Adobe Flash Player to view the page\u2019s content by going through nine (9) dialogue boxes to give acceptance to different permissions that will allow the malware operators initiate the malware configuration process. The immediate consequence to this, is that TangleBot gains access to several different permissions when installed on a device, allowing it to eavesdrop on user communications. The malware then steals sensitive data stored on the device and monitors almost every user activity, including camera use, audio conversations, and location, among other things.

In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC). As the malware evolved, the developer also added a feature akin to ransomware; the ability to encrypt files stored on a mobile device and its SD card known as AnubisCrypt. Furthermore, Anubis is able to receive commands from social media platforms including Twitter and messaging apps such as Telegram. Operators of the malware have been using <e1>Twitter</e1> and Google short links to send remote commands to the malware.

Upon further investigation, it turns out that a form of KISMET was also used between October and December 2019 to compromise some of the same targets, as well as the phone of a journalist at London-based Al Araby TV. \u201cGiven the global reach of NSO Group\u2019s customer base and the apparent vulnerability of almost all iPhone devices prior to the iOS 14 update, we suspect that the infections that we observed were a miniscule fraction of the total attacks leveraging this exploit,\u201d according to Citizen Lab. KISMET likely doesn\u2019t work against iOS 14 and above, which includes new security protections, Citizen Labs noted. Apple meanwhile is looking into the issue. Inside One Victim\u2019s Attack Tamer Almisshal, a well-known investigative journalist for Al Jazeera\u2019s Arabic language channel, in January agreed to installing a VPN application that allowed Citizen Lab researchers to monitor metadata associated with his internet traffic, because he thought he was a likely target for hacking. \u201cWhile reviewing his VPN logs, we noticed that on 19 July 2020, his phone visited a website that we had detected in our internet scanning as an installation server for NSO Group\u2019s Pegasus spyware, which is used in the process of infecting a target with Pegasus,\u201d according to Citizen Lab. In the 54 minutes leading up to that ping, the phone also visited 228 cloud partitions \u2013 a highly unusual activity, the firm said.

Furthermore, the malware takes complete control of the targeted device, including access to banking data, and can reach the deepest recesses of the Android operating system. The NCC, therefore, wishes to, once again, urge millions of telecom consumers in Nigeria to be wary of such wiles of cyber criminals, whose intent is to defraud unsuspecting Internet users. In order to ensure maximum protection for Internet users in the country, the ngCERT has offered a number of preventive measures to be taken by the consumers. These measures include an advisory to telecom consumers and other Internet users to refrain from opening Uniform Resource Locators (URLs) from unknown sources while using your mobile devices. Additionally, telecom consumers should never respond or send reply to messages or call back a phone number that is associated with the text that they are unaware of. Should any telecom consumer or Internet user become curious and wish to ascertain the authenticity of any call or messages and wish to probe the incident, such persons may do a web search of both the number and the message content. The NCC hereby reiterates that mobile users are under obligation to practice safe messaging practices and avoid clicking on any links in texts, even if they appear to come from a legitimate contact. Indeed, it is important to be judicious when downloading apps by reading install prompts closely, looking out for information regarding rights and privileges that the app may request. Other risk-mitigating measures advised by ngCERT is for users to be cautious of procuring any software from outside a certified <e2>app store</e2>.

For instance, the Trojan could automatically reply to an SMS and immediately delete it. Rotexy then sent information about the smartphone to the C&C, including the phone model, number, name of the mobile network operator, versions of the operating system and IMEI. With each subsequent request, a new subdomain was generated. The algorithm for generating the lowest-level domain name was hardwired in the Trojan\u2019s code. The Trojan also registered in Google Cloud Messaging (GCM), meaning it could then receive commands via that service. The Trojan\u2019s list of possible commands has remained practically unchanged throughout its life, and will be described below in detail.

The vulnerability allows attackers to deliver the malware payload when a target clicks on a link leading to a malicious webpage. Once installed, Pegasus exploits kernel flaws to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more. Apple patched the vulnerability last week when it released iOS 9.3.5. It appears the same WebKit and kernel vulnerabilities that enable Pegasus to effectively infiltrate iOS devices also exist in OS X. To combat potential exposure, Apple issued a combined security update for OS X Yosemite and El Capitan, as well as a standalone fix for the Safari web browser. The combined OS X update includes the Safari patch.

The malicious Dardesh chat app was apparently downloaded and installed by over a hundred users, after having been promoted via a long-running Facebook profile that posted the link to the app located on Google Play. Once installed, the app would download a second app that masqueraded as a generic \u201csettings\u201d application, which is capable of tracking the device\u2019s location, record calls, video, and surrounding audio, retrieve files found on external storage and them to a C&C server, retrieve text messages, contacts and account information, uninstall apps, and more. \u201cThe surveillance functionality of Desert Scorpion resides in a second stage payload that can only be downloaded if the victim has downloaded, installed, and interacted with the first-stage chat application,\u201d the researchers pointed out.

ThreatFabric\u2019s analysis of recent Ginp samples showed that it reused some code from Anubis, an Android malware family notorious for its use in cyberespionage activities before being retooled as a banking trojan. Ginp\u2019s trojan functions Upon execution in a victim device, Ginp removes its icon from the app drawer before asking the user for Accessibility Service privilege. Once it receives the said privilege, it grants itself additional permissions for sending messages and making calls. Ginp is capable of sending or harvesting SMS messages based on received commands. It can also request admin privileges, enable overlay attacks, update the command-and-control (C&C) URL, update the target list, set itself as the default SMS app, prevent the user from disabling Accessibility Services, get installed apps or contacts, enable call forwarding, and hide itself and prevent removal, among other capabilities.

Anubis is able to take screenshots, record audio, send, receive, and delete SMS messages, steal contact lists and account credentials, open URLs -- potentially to download additional payloads -- and is also able to disable Google Play Protect. In addition, the Trojan is able to plunder the deeper settings of a compromised device by enabling or tampering with device administration settings, to view running tasks, and to create a backdoor for remote control through virtual network computing (VNC).

APT-C-23 has been active since at least 2015 when U.S. cybersecurity firms Palo Alto Networks and ThreatConnect identified a campaign by the group targeting the United States, Israel, Palestinian Territories and Egypt. The malware allows its users to steal data from a target\u2019s phone including text messages, device location, contacts and more. It can record phone calls, video and surrounding audio. Desert Scorpion can also uninstall apps. In short, it makes a target\u2019s phone completely transparent. Desert Scorpion was spotted in a Google Play Store app called Dardesh. It was removed after Lookout notified Google on April 3. Judging by social media promotion across Facebook, it looks like the app was first spun up in February 2018. You can see the app\u2019s Play Store page below: Desert Scorpion\u2019s spying functionality turns on after a target has downloaded and used the chat app, which is really just a \u201cdropper\u201d for malware pretending to be a settings application. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to see more multi-stage attacks happen,\u201d said Andrew Blaich, Lookout\u2019s head of device intelligence. \u201cEspecially those that make it into the Play Store. Using a multi-stage process allows the attackers to hide the malicious functionality and the [command and control] infrastructure, while also increasing the odds of making it into the Play Store. When an app is in the main app store, it decreases the typical level of vetting a user may have on an app, since it has a higher level of trust and because the user doesn\u2019t need to allow unknown sources for app installations.\u201d Several of the malware\u2019s package names include the word \u201cFateh\u201d which is likely a signal toward continuously targeting the Fatah political party.

Our analysis indicates that the threat actors are no longer limiting their campaigns to East Asian countries, but are targeting additional countries around the world. THREAT ANALYSIS Infection Vector: Smishing Your Device Thus far, FakeSpy campaigns are characterized by SMS phishing (a.k.a. smishing). These SMS messages masquerade as a message from the local post office and link to the FakeSpy download. In a previous campaign reported by JPCERT, mobile users were alerted by phishy messages containing \u201cdelivery updates\u201d purportedly from Sagawa Express. Clicking the SMS link brings the user to a fake website that prompts them to download and install the FakeSpy APK, which is masquerading as a local postal service app. Targeting Postal and Transportation Services Companies One of the most significant findings is that new versions of FakeSpy target not only Korean and Japanese speakers, but also almost any postal service company around the world. All recent FakeSpy versions contain the same code with minor changes. The FakeSpy malware has been found to masquerade as any of the following companies: United States Postal Service - An independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government. USPS is the most well-known branch of the US government and provides a publicly funded postal service. Royal Mail - British postal service and courier company.

[SEP]", "[CLS] Risk of iOS attacks, at the moment, are negligible because the <e2>Apple App</e2> certificate needed to install the fake App Store installed by DualToy on iOS devices has expired, researchers said. Palo Alto notes, during the past two years there have been similar cases of Windows and Apple iOS malware designed to attack mobile devices via side-loading techniques. \u201cThis attack vector is increasingly popular with malicious actors\u2026 WireLurker installed malicious apps on non-jailbroken iPhones. The HackingTeam\u2019s RCS delivered its spyware from infected PCs and Macs to jailbroken iOS devices and BlackBerry phones,\u201d Xiao said. So far, DualToy mainly targets Chinese users, but researchers say it has also infected users in the United States, United Kingdom, Thailand, Spain and Ireland. Xiao said, in order for the Trojan to infect an iOS device the target must have already set up a trusted pairing relationship between the PC and the iPhone or iPad. Researchers say its unclear how DualToy Trojan gets on Windows machines. But once DualToy is on a PC, it downloads from a command-and-control server a file called adb.exe, which is the standard Android Debug Bridge on Windows clients. But more recent variants of DualToy drop a custom ADB client, tadb.exe, onto a victim\u2019s PC. The malware also downloads two installers AppleMobileDeviceSupport64.msi and AppleApplicationSupport64.msi, part of Apple\u2019s official iTunes for Windows software. On Android devices, DualToy installs several Chinese language apps that researchers suspect attackers are getting paid per install by game developers. On iOS devices, DualToy installs a fake iOS App Store used to try to trick users into divulging their iTunes username and password. The use of a fake iOS App Store is not unique. \u201cThe app is yet another third party iOS App Store just like <e1>ZergHelper</e1>. It also has exactly the same behavior as AceDeceiver.

A RAT enables its operators to perform many activities on the compromised device (e.g. control a device's camera, access its storage, intercept calls and text messages, etc.). This is all done via an easy-to-use application hosted on a command and control server.

More digging uncovered KISMET, the apparent exploit delivered through Apple\u2019s servers, that served as the initial access vector. In the past, NSO Group delivered malicious SMS messages with links that delivered the payload; in this case, it\u2019s a zero-click process that may involve the attacker merely sending an iMessage to the target \u2014 no user interaction required, according to Citizen Lab. The data exfiltration began swiftly: Just 16 seconds after the last connection was made to the Pegasus installation server, Almisshal\u2019s iPhone contacted three new IP addresses \u2013 likely Pegasus command-and-control servers (C2s). It continued to contact the IPs over the next 16 hours, Citizen Lab said, with 270.16MB of data uploaded, and 15.15MB of data downloaded. Almisshal\u2019s device also showed a large number of random phone crashes between January and July. \u201cWhile some of [these] may be benign, they may also indicate earlier attempts to exploit vulnerabilities against his device,\u201d researchers noted.

Using this, DualToy invokes APIs in iTunes\u2019 iTunesMobileDevice.dll file via reflection, so that it can interact with iOS devices just like iTunes does. DualToy will watch for USB connections. Once there\u2019s a valid iOS device connected, it will try to connect to it using iTunes APIs.

On August 10th 2020 he shared the source code of Cerberus with the administrator of the underground forum in which he was renting it out. As we forecasted, shortly after, the source code of the Trojan became available to the general public. You might wonder why the number of samples drops and barely increases again despite the source code being publicly available. There are two reasons: firstly, actors who got their hands on the code need to understand how to setup the backend (C2) and builder, secondly the actors which successfully built samples noticed that their payload is immediately detected by Play Protect when installed on an Android device and therefore are now probably working on rearranging the code (resulting in their own code fork). All samples detected since the official Cerberus service interruption are test samples and no large-scale or successful campaign has been observed so far.

Based on a thorough analysis of the code, the most interesting technical capabilities include: Capturing screenshots Enabling or changing administration settings Opening and visiting any URL Disabling Play Protect Recording audio Making phone calls Stealing the contact list Controlling the device via VNC Sending, receiving and deleting SMS Locking the device Encrypting files on the device and external drives Searching for files Retrieving the GPS location Capturing remote control commands from Twitter and Telegram Pushing overlays Reading the device ID The malware includes a keylogger that works in every app installed on the Android device. However, the keylogger needs to be specifically enabled by a command sent from the C2 server. The keylogger can track three different events (Figure 5): TYPE_VIEW_CLICKED Represents the event of clicking on a View-like Button, CompoundButton, etc. TYPE_VIEW_FOCUSED Represents the event of setting input focus of a View. TYPE_VIEW_TEXT_CHANGED Represents the event of changing the text of an EditText. Figure 6 shows one of the most noteworthy functions of Anubis: its <e2>ransomware</e2> module. [SEP]", "[CLS] By the end of February 2020, the operators had added screen capture capabilities, and the malware code seemed to be borrowed from the <e1>Anubis</e1> <e2>trojan</e2> source code. [SEP]", "[CLS] Perhaps the malware\u2019s most troubling capability, <e1>SpyNote</e1> allows the attacker to execute commands. \u201cCommand execution can create havoc for victim if the malware developer decides to execute commands in the victim\u2019s device. Leveraging this feature, the malware developer can root the device using a range of vulnerabilities, well-known or zero-day,\u201d Shivang Desai, a researcher with the firm wrote Tuesday. When it comes to surveillance, the RAT can take screen captures \u2013 and by taking advantage of the way the device handles audio \u2013 record conversations. According to researchers the malware hijacks the MediaProjection.Callback API, something first introduced in Android 5.0 Lollipop, to record audio. It saves the recorded content in a file, \u201cvideo.mp4,\u201d that can be sent back to the C2. Like other RATs, this version of SpyNote can also steal SMS messages and contacts from infected devices and funnel them back to the C2. The malware steals the contacts and writes them as a local array before they\u2019re exfiltrated, Desai said. It also, for good measure, collects the device\u2019s location and sends that along to attackers. While the RAT is sophisticated, there\u2019s one catch, the firm claims. In order for the RAT to work, the infected device has to be connected to WiFi. That way it can transmit data and files to its C+C unfettered. It\u2019s likely not the last we\u2019ll hear about SpyNote in 2017, the firm claims, adding that researchers there uncovered a handful of copycat apps built with the same SpyNote malware builder. Apps designed to mimic Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook, <e2>Super Mario Run</e2>, and Pokemon Go are all making the rounds in the hacking community. [SEP]", "[CLS] <e2>Lookout</e2> Finds New Surveillanceware In Google Play With Ties To Known Threat Actor Targeting The Middle East Lookout researchers have identified a new, highly targeted surveillanceware family known as <e1>Desert Scorpion</e1> in the Google Play Store. [SEP]", "[CLS] You may review your application list in \u201cSettings -> Apps\u201d, if you find one of this applications, please consider downloading an antivirus product such as <e2>Check Point</e2> ZoneAlarm to check if you are indeed infected. We have noticed that hundreds of the email addresses are associated with enterprise accounts worldwide. How do you know if your Google account is breached? You can check if your account is compromised by accessing the following web site that we created: https://gooligan.checkpoint.com/. If your account has been breached, the following steps are required: A clean installation of an operating system on your mobile device is required (a process called \u201cflashing\u201d). As this is a complex process, we recommend powering off your device and approaching a certified technician, or your mobile service provider, to request that your device be \u201cre-flashed.\u201d Change your Google account passwords immediately after this process. How do Android devices become infected? We found traces of the Gooligan malware code in dozens of legitimate-looking apps on third-party Android app stores. These stores are an attractive alternative to Google Play because many of their apps are free, or offer free versions of paid apps. However, the security of these stores and the apps they sell aren\u2019t always verified. Gooligan-infected apps can also be installed using phishing scams where attackers broadcast links to infected apps to unsuspecting users via SMS or other messaging services. How did Gooligan emerge? Our researchers first encountered Gooligan\u2019s code in the malicious SnapPea app last year. At the time this malware was reported by several security vendors, and attributed to different malware families like Ghostpush, <e1>MonkeyTest</e1>, and Xinyinhe. [SEP]", "[CLS] Lookout said there is \"currently no evidence\" the actor successfully deployed it against the <e1>Israeli Defense Force</e1> this time around, but did not name a new target. Meanwhile, the Desert Scorpion app also uses a second-stage payload that downloads malicious components when a user interacts with the app. That component gains almost unfettered access to the device -- and the ability to grab devices, metadata, track a user's locations, send messages, record surrounding audio, calls, and video -- all while running silently in the background. Lookout said an advanced persistent threat group, known as APT-C-23, is likely the suspect behind the malware. Not only that, similarities in the command and control infrastructures of Desert Scorpion and FrozenCell suggest the two malware families may indicate a common actor or developer. Previously, it's been assumed APT-C-23 is a little-known advanced persistent threat actor dating back to 2015. The attackers are said to be \"highly active\" hackers, thought to be linked to Hamas, given that previous targets have included rival Palestinian political party Fatah. In both cases, the actors behind the malicious apps used phishing schemes to trick targets into downloading the apps. But what makes the apps so effective is that they were downloadable from Android's official app store, Google Play, lending the apps a level of credibility. That's because most rudimentary malware apps don't get installed without an Android users actively lowering their own security settings in order to install apps outside of the supposedly protective wall of <e2>Google</e2>'s app store. [SEP]", "[CLS] Names like Anubis, Hydra, <e1>Ginp</e1>, or Gustuff appear on all mobile malware lists on a recurring basis. However, the one that has dominated the arena this year \u2013for several reasons\u2013 is Cerberus: a nightmare-inducing rodent. Cerberus, the king of all RATs Cerberus is a highly sophisticated Android malware, in circulation since 2019. It has been actively distributed on dark web forums, in a \u201cmalware-as-a-service\u201d (MaaS) format. For a sum between $4,000 and $12,000, cybercriminal groups capable of paying it have had all the malware tools at their disposal. And by tools, we mean an arsenal of destruction. Cerberus was conceived as a run-of-the-mill banking and phishing malware, and seeing Anubis\u2019s success with cybercriminals, the team decided to integrate RAT capabilities into their toolset. Its victim is the banking apps inside your smartphone, but its functionality is much more complex. Like any Remote Access Trojan worth its salt, Cerberus is capable of deep surveillance within your device, interfering with the encrypted communications the phone has with its apps, and outside. Basically, Cerberus can intercept and steal your phone\u2019s unlock pattern or PIN, as well as Google Authenticator numbers, and any SMS necessary to perform a two-step verification. Likewise, this malware can interpose itself between you and your bank\u2019s app through an overlay, the most common method for carrying out a phishing attack. In short, Cerberus can enter your computer, extract all the necessary data to perform a bank fraud, and wait for the best moment to take the money from your account. All without you doing anything. Cerberus and its complex functionality Regarding what Cerberus can do, it is necessary to point out two possibilities within its functionality. We already mentioned that Cerberus is a RAT, but to achieve such control of the phone, it is necessary to have control of a vulnerability. In this case, it is the <e2>Android Accessibility Service</e2>. This service, which normally assists users with disabilities in certain applications, is abused by Cerberus to give itself more permissions without user interaction.

Dubbed \"Pegasus,\" the assault package leverages three zero-day vulnerabilities to remotely jailbreak and install a suite of monitoring software onto a victim's device. One of the key tools in the process is an exploit that takes advantage of a memory corruption flaw in Safari WebKit. The vulnerability allows attackers to deliver the malware payload when a target clicks on a link leading to a malicious webpage. Once installed, Pegasus exploits <e2>kernel flaws</e2> to upgrade privileges, allowing attackers to intercept text messages, pilfer emails, access contacts and steal information from a variety of third-party apps including Gmail, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, WeChat and more.

It can also initiate a phone call without going through the Dialer user interface to confirm, block calls from banks and connect with bots via Twitter in case its command and control server (C&C) happens to go offline. Researchers said the malware has a UI to enable the device admin access, and does not allow the user to disable it once enabled. \u201cThe malware sets itself up as a default telephony provider, mostly for intercepting SMS messages,\u201d researchers said. \u201cA list of phone numbers to be intercepted can be controlled by the C&C server. Messages from these numbers may be hidden from the user. Intercepted messages are also sent to the C&C server. This could be used for intercepting 2 factor authentication codes used by most services these days including online banking.\u201d Once the malware has full access to the infected device, it can even wipe out all data from the device. The malware is shipped via spam emails delivering .APK (Android Package Kit) attachments and it targets Android devices running Android marshmallow and later.

[SEP]", "[CLS] From our analysis of the <e2>TrickMo</e2> mobile malware, it is apparent that TrickMo is designed to break the newest methods of OTP and, specifically, TAN codes often used in Germany. Among the various features we discuss in this post, we believe that TrickMo\u2019s most significant novelty is an app recording feature, which gives it the ability to overcome the newer pushTAN app validations used by German banks. In the analysis that follows, we describe in detail the capabilities of this new variant and a \u201ckill switch\u201d that can remotely eliminate the malware from a mobile device. Why Do Desktop Trojans Use a Mobile Component? About a decade ago, attackers wielding banking Trojans could simply use stolen credentials to access a victim\u2019s online banking account and perform money transfers. As a countermeasure, financial institutions introduced various second factor authentication (2FA) methods. One method, which was popular in Germany, is known as mobile TAN (mTAN). It was implemented by sending an SMS message containing a one-time password (OTP) to the client\u2019s mobile device. The transaction would only be authorized after the client enters the TAN into the online banking website in their browser. Keep in mind that while this case is about TANs, it can be any OTP, depending on which bank is being targeted. Meanwhile, desktop banking Trojans developed the ability to execute various social engineering schemes by using web injections, a method that alters the content presented to the infected victim in their browser. In some cases, sophisticated web injects were used to trick victims into entering their 2FA codes directly into the web forms controlled by the malware to eliminate the need for the mobile malware component. But attackers were still constantly looking for new methods to steal TANs. Around 2011, the infamous <e1>Zeus</e1> Trojan started using web injects that tricked users into downloading a mobile component called \u201cZitMo\u201d (Zeus in the Mobile). [SEP]", "[CLS] The last quarter of 2020 will probably come with some additional changes to the threat landscape, especially since the source code of the <e1>Cerberus</e1> Trojan has been made publicly available. In the coming months we can definitively expect some new malware families, based on Cerberus, to emerge. The most important aspect to take care of is securing the <e2>online banking</e2> channels, making fraud hard to perform, discouraging criminals to attempt the attacks and making it less useful for them to build more malware.

The BankBot Anubis malware then masquerades as an app called \u201cGoogle Protect\u201d and prompts the user to grant it accessibility rights. Why ask for accessibility? BankBot Anubis uses Android\u2019s Accessibility services to perform keylogging as a way to obtain the infected user\u2019s credentials when he or she accesses a targeted mobile banking app. In most Android banking Trojans, the malware launches a fake overlay screen when the user accesses a target app. The user then taps his or her account credentials into the fake overlay, which allows the malware to steal the data. BankBot Anubis streamlines this process. By keylogging the user\u2019s login information, the attacker can steal credentials from any app while avoiding the need to create custom overlays for each target. This malware is also able to take screen captures of the user\u2019s screen, which it likely uses to steal credentials since the keyboard strokes are visible.

Researchers at ThreatFabric, the cybersecurity firm based in Amsterdam, have been following an \u201cinteresting new strain of banking malware\u201d dubbed Ginp distributed as Adobe Flash Player. Identified firstly by Kaspersky\u2019s Android malware analyst Tatyana Shishkova in late October; Ginp is currently targeting users in the UK and Spain. Researchers opine that the Trojan was actually launched in June 2019 and is yet under the active development phase. According to researchers, cybercriminals have released at least five different versions of Ginp in the past five months, which reflects how eagerly cybercriminals are vying to improvise this Trojan. ThreatFabric analysts claim that Ginp is unique because its codebase was developed from scratch and is being expanded continuously through updates. Its target list is also considerably narrow as its main targets are the banks in Spain. The code of Gino has been copied from the code of another infamous Trojan called Anubis. Researchers further claim that there are striking similarities between the codes of both Trojans but it cannot be said that Ginp is the replica of <e1>Anubis</e1> rather it is inspired by Anubis.

The tool was also reportedly used to track people close to murdered Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. It is unclear who or what types of people are being targeted and why. However, much of the recent reporting about Pegasus centers around a list of 50,000 phone numbers. The list has been attributed to NSO Group, but the list\u2019s origins are unclear.

Analysis of the malicious iOS profile also revealed further connections, as the profile can also be downloaded from a website that FakeSpy deployed early this year. Conclusion and security recommendations The continued monitoring of XLoader showed how its operators continuously changed its features, such as its attack vector deployment infrastructure and deployment techniques. This newest entry seems to indicate that these changes won\u2019t be stopping soon. Being aware of this fact can help create defensive strategies, as well as prepare for upcoming attacks. In addition, just as uncovering new characteristics is important, finding ones we\u2019ve also seen in a different malware family like FakeSpy also provides valuable insight. Links between XLoader and FakeSpy can give clues to the much broader inner workings of the threat actors behind them. Perhaps more information on XLoader will be known in the future. For now, users can make the best of the knowledge they have now to significantly reduce the effectivity of such malware. Users of iOS can remove the malicious profile using the Apple Configurator 2, Apple\u2019s official iOS helper app for managing Apple devices.

Succeeding monitoring efforts revealed a newer variant that exploits the social media platforms Instagram and Tumblr instead of Twitter to hide its C&C address. We labeled this new variant XLoader version 7.0, because of the different deployment method and its use of the native code to load the payload and hide in Instagram and Tumblr profiles.
